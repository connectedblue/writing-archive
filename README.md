# Writing Archive

A digital archive of my writing and images intended for preservation and use far into the future.

## The purpose of this archive

I would like my writing to be available for reading in 200 years.  I have no idea what technology will be available then, so I will do my best while I'm alive to replicate this archive in multiple places.  This is done in the hope that it will be replicated intact by future owners of platforms where it resides.

The canonical version of this archive while I am alive is at:

[https://github.com/connectedblue/writing-archive](https://github.com/connectedblue/writing-archive)

I will maintain a list of other places where the content is placed as I create them.


## Use of this archive

I have made this work available under Creative Commons Zero to provide as little legal friction as possible.

This is a publicly available archive which you may replicate and use however you wish.  Please note, as per the licence, that I offer no warrant or accept any liability arising from any use of this archive.

I'm aware this means that the work could easily  be replicated and modified thousands of times by bots or anyone else.  This will make it impossible to determine what my original writing was.  While I am alive, I'll maintain and secure the canonical version on the link above.  I will also try and develop a digital signature which can identify and authenticate wholly unmodified copies stored elsewhere.
