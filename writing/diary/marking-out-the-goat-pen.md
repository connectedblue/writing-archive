I headed down early to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) this morning. I was on my own, but wanted to finish off the perimeter section for the goats. Everything is now in place for them to arrive very soon, so the electric fencing needs to be installed.

I walked around the site first, just to get the measure of what was left to be done and then attached the new strimmer head to the brush cutter. I would have preferred the blade because I was still in the scrub part, but it had been removed and I couldn't find all the bits.

Anyway, it turned out to be just as good using the nylon, because it wasn't very woody. I did have to be extra careful not to try and use up all the cord. When it did run out though, I managed to find a replacement in the tool shed.

I was finished by half eleven, so I gave Vicky a call to let her know I'd do the watering before I left so she wouldn't have to come down.

I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of yellow rattle in the top wildflower patch. I hadn't really spotted much in the preceding weeks, but it all seemed to sprout up. That was started with only a handful of seed last year, so hopefully this year we'll get loads more spread about.
