A lot of team work at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) today. We continued to cut the bramble back in the meadow, which in places was taking up half the width. I was on brush cutter duty, but it's important to rake and remove the cut vegetation to reduce the nutrient content of the soil.

It was a cold day but, as ever, we had a warming meal to look forward to at lunch time.

Chilli and rice served with pakora which hit the spot perfectly.

In the afternoon, another session of Code Club at the library. Sim is running these, and I'm getting the hang of how they work, with a view to running them myself after Easter. It was pretty chaotic ... lots of children had registered with two per PC. But it was very good fun and looks like it will be a fabulous future activity to lead.
