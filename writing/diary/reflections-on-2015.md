A year of work and holidays. It was our 10 year wedding anniversary which we spent up in Torridon. But also discovered the benefit of winter sun in the Canary Islands, as well as the week long trip to the Crickhowell Walking festival.

I had started up a new consulting company called Connected Blue, but spent the first three months of the year not really working. I then secured two part time contracts through my network. One with Avios in Gatwick, and the other with First Utility in Warwick.

I would work the first half of the week in Gatwick, staying over at my Mum's house. And then commute to Warwick. So a lot of driving. But both companies were good to work for and I had some interesting projects.

In September, there was a Banksy Exhibition called Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare. It was a brilliant take on theme parks and absolutely packed with art in every corner.

Towards the end of the year, Daniel contracted encephalitis and was in hospital for two months into 2016. This added to the driving pressure since I then had to triangle work with Derby to visit him. He suffered very severe memory loss, and although he knew and recognised me, his short and medium term memory were completely gone.

There was a trip to Wembley for the conference play off final, which Bristol Rovers won on penalties, capping off an unremarkable season but at least they were back in the league.
