Returned to the cricket club with [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/) where we continued to tackle the enormous amount of Himalayan Balsam in the lower part of Ebley meadows.

It was only a couple of weeks since [we were last there](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/07/plantations-of-balsam/), but the growth made a much more challenging environment. It was mostly over 6 foot, and interspersed with tall nettles, and in places, hidden giant hogweed. The weather started out pretty drizzly, but soon cleared and remained muggy all morning.

We finished a bit earlier today at 1.30pm so we could make our way to the sensory garden at Stratford park for the annual volunteer and community picnic.

This is always a good chance to catch up with the other people and projects who I don't see so regularly.

Claire gave a short talk on some of the projects that might get underway over the next year, if funding gets approved. As ever, these are precarious times, but the work SVP does for the community and environment is a vital contributor to well being in the local area.
