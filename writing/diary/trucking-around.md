We had a plan with [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/) to put up bird and bat boxes today in various locations around the Fromebridge reserve. We got off to a good start by assembling a couple behind the new fencing. There were more of us than needed for this part of the task, so some of us set off to work on the bat boxes in the wood a bit further away.

Disaster soon struck though as the truck became stuck in the track towards the wood. This has happened a few times this year, and we initially thought it would be an easy job to remove.

Unfortunately we didn't really have the right tools, not even a spade.

We found a few branches and brash to place under the wheels to give grip, but nothing was sticking - the wheels were just spinning. We retrieved some spare sheep netting to try and make a friction surface, but nothing seemed to work.

After a couple of hours, we met with Pete who brought some more tools and we filled the wheelbarrow with aggregate to try and make a ramp. We threw in the towel and arranged for another GWT truck to come and winch it out, and at that point there was little more the team could do so we went home.

It finally got resolved by a local farmer who brought his truck to tow it out.
