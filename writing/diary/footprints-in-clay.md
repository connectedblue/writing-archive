I set out early this morning for the regular raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). River levels are still pretty high, but the location I check is below a pumping station, so that is always relatively shallow and the same depth all year round.

The first raft had a few signs, but the droppings have been mostly washed away so it's difficult to tell what it was. I don't think water vole though.

However the second raft was the best set of prints I've ever picked up. There are clear star shaped prints which are classic water vole. Plus there were rat markings there also.

The second raft also had a possible latrine, but again it was difficult to make an assessment because it had mostly washed away in the recent weather.
