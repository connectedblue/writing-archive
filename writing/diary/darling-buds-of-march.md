I noticed the explosion of buds everywhere on the riverbank for my regular raft check for [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). The waters are still very, very high but I managed to access the rafts safely to check.

Possible signs on both rafts again of water voles and otter on one. There was quite a bit washed away with the rain so it's hard to be certain.

But I feel hopeful that as we get closer to the breeding season, we will see more concrete evidence.

In the afternoon, I went to the library to hold the last python [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) for this term. I had managed to code a quick prototype beforehand to help a group who are coding a game together. I took their static composition of a submarine and gave it some movement as you move the cursor around. This gave them ideas for the next part of their game.
