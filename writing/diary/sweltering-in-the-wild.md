It was a baking day at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). The previous day had seen some of the rain, but generally everything was dry.

The main task was to remove the bramble, dock and creeping thistle from the wildflower patch before they go to seed. These plants tend to shade and dominate the other species, so we don't want more of them next year. The whole area will be brush cut in the autumn to allow everything to start again next year.

The bees are also happy in their hive. A medium sized swarm was placed there last week and the beekeepers visited today to check on the health and whether pollen is being brought to the queen.

Fewer people stayed for lunch today but those that did were served a treat.

Our Iranian friend cooked us a deliciously spiced potato and rice dish with pickled beetroot and shredded cabbage.

Our artists have been hard at work. Wendy painted an amazing 8 foot sign for the kitchen showing where all the various tasks should be done in the sink area. We are very fortunate to have such creative talents to decorate the site.
