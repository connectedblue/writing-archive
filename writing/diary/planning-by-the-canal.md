In a couple of weeks I'm giving a talk at the AGM of the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk) about the work the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust are doing along the Stroudwater Canal.

To prepare for it, I met with Pete who is the Project Officer for the wildlife trust on the environmental aspects of the project. I do a lot of work with him, so I'm very familiar with the project, but it was good to take the time to run through everything from scratch. Always new details to pick up on that I hadn't heard before.

We came up with a good narrative, and he gave me some supporting materials and resources for the talk. Look forward to putting the presentation together over the next few days.
