The grasslands at the top of Rodborough are always worth a special trip at this time of year. There are so many species .... fragrant orchid, common milkwort, early purple orchid, green-winged orchid, common rock-rose, yellow wort and common spotted orchid. That was just in a small section without really looking too hard.

But the immediate thing that strikes you looking down the south west facing grass slopes is the abundance of yellow rattle. Literally tens of thousands of plants tumbling down.

I completed a three mile circuit around the common, and it was the same wherever you look. The weather was stunning, and it's hard to think of a more beautiful part of the world to live.
