This was the [second day of building](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/11/gimme-shelter/) the orchard shelter for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). The forecast for the day was good, and the plan was to get the upright posts securely in the ground and some of the cross bar braces in place.

It turned out to be a good decision not to cut the pieces to size beforehand. There are so many variations in the ground levels that flexibility is needed to get everything as square as possible.

The first job was to secure the four outside posts with rubble, clay and top soil. A small layer was added at a time and tampered firmly into the ground before adding more.

All the while, we were constantly checking that all four posts were square to each other and level upright in themselves. Many measurements were taken and in the end everything was within 10mm of each other, which will not affect a structure of this size.

Next job was to put the horizontal cross bars in at ground level. This is when the slop really becomes apparent as there is a 30cm drop between the left hand side and the right hand side. We used clamps to hold everything in place while adjustments were made, and then fencing screws provided a firmer fix. Next time, bolts will be drilled all the way through to make a secure final construction.

The innovation of the day from Matt was a tiny spirit left that can be attached to string to get the level at height. This meant the upper cross braces could be marked in place precisely by pencil first, and then easily secured with the clamps and screws. This saved holding the heavy beams above head height while trying to check the levels.

At the same time, Diane started to dig the final two holes for the uprights which we can put in next time. There'll then be the roof rafters and side beams for fixing the panels to. There's probably another three days work required to complete the basic shelter.
