Flowers appeared at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) over the last week. There has been quite a bit of cutting and clearing the wildflower areas, and I saw a hedgerow cranesbill geranium in flower today. This is clearly not right and a reflection of the totally unpredictable climate cycles we are now experiencing.

Work continues on the kitchen. I put in some temporary waste plumbing pipes to allow the sinks to be used and then shovelled loose gravel into the trench at the back.

Somehow, despite all the kitchen chaos, Cherie cooked up the most delicious food for lunchtime. It was bursting with flavour and freshness.

In the afternoon, I held the last of the autumn [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) sessions. A boy there has attended every one I've held since March (sometimes he was the only one there!). He has decided to do rugby now for a while after school and will return to coding next year. He gave me a card and a box of chocolates which was very nice to receive. But the real privilege and pleasure has been seeing him develop his coding skills over the last few months.
