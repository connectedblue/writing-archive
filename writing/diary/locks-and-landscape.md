This is the last active day of my holiday. Plotted a new route that takes in a long stretch of canal returning over the other side of the valley from the cottage.

The first section was a pleasant downward section, taking in a wide vista of the black mountains in the distance.

It wasn't long before the towpath appeared, and an easy mile and a half walk into Llangynidr.

There is a series of 5 locks, constructed in 1799 - a triple and two singles. Together they raise and lower the canal 48 feet, and each one contains 40,000 gallons of water. An amazing feat of engineering and still in use today.

A visit to the [Walnut Tree cafe](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057658562318) for lunch proved to be a hit. Fresh homemade food, eaten in their outdoor marquee dining area. A leisurely walk back through more wildflower hedgerow, with betony, wood cranesbill, toadflax and selfheal all in flower.

Unfortunately the injured shoulder I picked up earlier in the week has not gone away which makes walking very uncomfortable and sleeping impossible. So the holiday will be cut one day short and return to the Cotswolds tomorrow.
