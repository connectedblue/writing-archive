Headed over to Northleach where, some years ago, [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) restored a meadow in the valley behind the old prison. There is an increasing problem with dock in the field. Dock is a native, invasive species which shades out other wildflowers if it's allowed to spread unchecked.

The objective today was to remove the seed stalks from the majority of the dock. This means that they won't spread further this year, but being a perennial, the existing plants will regrow.

To dig them out properly is a lot of work, since the root goes deep. So the priority was just to cut as low as possible and carefully remove the seed heads away from the area.

We started along the top boundary, where there was effectively a thick dock hedge. It was masking a newly planted hedge boundary, so our work freed more light into those plants for the remainder of the season which will be beneficial.

We had ton bags for the arisings and made two large piles at each end of the field. The seeds can stay active for up to two weeks after cutting, but we're hoping that the pile will create a warm core to heat up and hasten the decomposition.

There were five of us, but by mid afternoon we had removed pretty much all the dock and the meadow looked a lot healthier and managed. Sadly though, this task will no doubt have to be repeated next year.

There were a lot of species that we came across - grass vetchling and soft broomrape being a couple of the more unusual ones.
