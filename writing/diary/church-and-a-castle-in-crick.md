I couldn't do any walking today as I've been struck with a lower back pain that makes strenuous walking difficult.

Instead, I took a trip around Crickhowell. This is a town I know well from their annual walking festival. I've started and finished many a walk here, but never really had a look around the town itself.

There is a ruined castle from 1272 quite near the high street. Very little to see today, but the whole park has been turned into a beautiful wildflower meadow. The Viper's bugloss was in full flower, along with Knapweed.

There's also a rather stunning church, St Edmunds. From the outside, it looks rather plain, but inside there is a rather grand interior.

Finally took a look around the art gallery which had an interesting range of paintings and sculpture for sale.
