Change of plan today. I had a calendar entry to join [Stroud Valleys Projects](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/) on a task by the canal. But my arm is still playing up, having injured it some weeks ago. So I decided not to aggravate it any further and sadly told Ruth I wouldn't be attending.

Instead I took a trip to Stroud. Despite this being close, it's not a place I visit often. I'm usually just passing through on the way to the Slad Valley or the North Cotswolds.

There's a magnificent public space called [Stratford Park](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/parks-and-green-spaces/stratford-park). Its 56 acre grounds are packed with amenities like a musuem, sports area, wildflower meadow and and arboretum. Huge Turkey oaks, Cedars and Sequoias are some of the highlights.
