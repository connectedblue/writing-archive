Went down to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) to help out with the plant swap and sale. There are many held around the area today, and some people visit them all to seek out items for their gardens.

I contributed some tomato and courgette plants. There was a good stock which got replenished through the day as visitors bought more. All in we made about Â£100, a welcome contribution to the site running costs.

I spent the day in the outdoor kitchen on tea and cake duty. The delicious cakes were baked by Cherie and Solveig, and went down a treat with the guests.

I met a couple of people who I didn't know. It's always useful to increase contacts across the community and swap stories on projects of mutual interest. It was also an opportunity to promote the Dursley green drinks event that I'm organising with Jo in a couple of weeks.

In the evening, a whole crew of tractors descended on the village pub in the evening sun. An impressive sight to see all the machines together.
