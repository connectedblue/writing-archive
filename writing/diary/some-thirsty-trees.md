On the outskirts of the village is a small copse, planted earlier this year by some residents. A small WhatsApp group emerged, and over the weekend there was a call to water the saplings this afternoon.

The trees are located on the edge of a larger woodland, which had been recently felled of ash.

In the first year especially, young trees need looking after. A work party had already done a fine job mulching the base. Given the dry weather recently and forecast, it was time to give them a good drink.

The farmer had placed a tonne of water in a bowser at the back of the copse. This was very welcome, but was still hard work for the five of us to fill watering cans and visit each tree.

What was especially stunning was the field it was in. It has been kept back as a meadow this year and was full of many wildflowers. I spotted bush vetch, bugle, cow parsnip, hairy st john's wort and the cuckoo flower.

There is a plan to invite the primary school children for a picnic one afternoon. They helped to plant the trees and it will be good for them to see how much they have grown. We can also get them to spot how many different species of wildflowers they can see.
