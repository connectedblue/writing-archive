A smaller team met up today for the winter work party with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). We had additional wood to progress the orchard shelter, in addition to the continuing fencing work.

For the first part of the morning, I helped Matt put the additional roof support in place. There was a concern that the weight of the corrugated roof might cause the struts to bow.

So an additional three beams were placed into the structure. This will not only provide additional fixing to protect the roof in high wind, but will also prevent it sagging.

Once that task was completed, I donned the brush cutter PPE to cut the remaining scrub in the cleared fence line to make sure we had a very clear pathway when the fence itself is erected.

I finally made it to the end of the proposed fence in the top meadow. There is still plenty of material to dead hedge, and some more trees to remove, but we'll soon be able to bang in all the posts, reading for the sheep wire and barb.

A very warm and sunny day again today.
