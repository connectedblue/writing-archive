With the weather so warm, I didn't want a whole day's hiking, so settled for a 12km circular route to explore the area. This takes in Tor Y Foel, which I've done before but not this particular route up.

A very nice route up from the cottage, stopping half way up with a nice view of Talybont reservoir.

On getting to the top, it was still very warm at 550m, so a chance to sit and admire the view for a while (not something you do often in the usual cold and wet of welsh mountains).

The route down to Llangynidr was straightforward, and found a very nice spot next to the canal for lunch. Walked back on the opposite side of the valley, which meant a steep descent and then climb to get back to the other side.

All in all, a good way to explore the area on the first day.
