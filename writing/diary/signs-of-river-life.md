Headed out early this morning to meet Tony at Ebley Mill for our monthly survey with the [Riverfly Partnership](https://www.riverflies.org/). We had no worries beforehand about river levels, unlike every previous month this year.

It was clear and shallow and we were quickly in the water to commence the kick test. We followed our agreed methodology of only surveying half the river, even though we could have got all the way across. This keeps it consistent with being able to do it when river levels are high later in the year.

The first thing we noted was a proliferation of gammerus, many more than previous months. This made it hard initially to get the eye in for other species.

Very different set of readings today. No mayfly at all (and they were very numerous before). Perhaps because it is now June?? They were very large last month so have en-masse turned to adults.

They were replaced though by loads of blue-winged olives. I haven't seen quite so many at this site before. There were also a healthy number of regular olives. No cased caddisfly, which is always a favourite.

Overall, the score was 6 which is consistent with previous months despite the change in species mix. A good sign that the river remains healthy.

After finishing up at Ebley, I went to do the raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). Back up to three rafts now, after repairing the one that upturned over the winter. This was the first monitor of that raft for several months.

And it threw up a beauty ... really clear otter footprints on the cartridge.

I haven't seen prints quite this clear for many months.

The other locations didn't really have anything much of interest. No water vole signs, just marks from brown rat.

In the afternoon, I headed over to the library for the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) after the half term break last week. This is the web and python crew, but a few of them wanted to code in Scratch today which is great.

I was particularly impressed with George who with only a tiny amount of code produced a mesmerising animation with coloured squares. I am never failed to be impressed by the creativity of the Code Club.
