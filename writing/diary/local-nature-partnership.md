Today it was the conference of the [Gloucester Local Nature Partnership](https://www.gloucestershirenature.org.uk/) where partner organisations and interested individuals were invited to review the work and contribute to the 2024-27 strategy.

It was held at the Royal Agriculture college which is an excellent venue for these occasions.

The first part of the morning was a series of presentations on how the current strategy is progressing. Of particular interest was the section on social prescribing which is something that [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) participates in.

We then broke into tables and came up with themes to focus on for the next period. There was a lot of interesting discussion, but the general area of public engagement was a recurring topic.

I made a few new contacts, particularly with Gloucestershire University and the velcro collective. You never know exactly where and how networks will prove to be useful, but I have no doubt that opportunities will arise over the next year.

I missed the afternoon session as I had to return after lunch to run the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. This was the scratch club, but two boys wanted to learn some python so a good opportunity to get them started on that.
