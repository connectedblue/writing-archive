Last day of the [Crickhowell Walking Festival](https://www.crickhowellfestival.com/) and headed over to the other side of the park for a walk around the peaks and nature reserves to the West of Pen Y Fan.

This was a tough, 14 mile walk with experienced walkers from the area. I felt a bit fitter after the walk yesterday, but the terrain was much wetter and harder.

The route was stunning though. We picked our way around a figure of eight and visited woodland, open moor, farmland and peaks.

One of the walkers had been on [a walk I led](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/10/leading-up-three-hills/) last year, and he also spotted me when I was on the [adder work party](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/01/habitat-for-adders/) up at Kilkenny in January. He was on walk that passed through the reserve and saw my bright PPE kit. It's a small world.

I spent most of the walk at the back, but we returned to the cars at about 4.30pm which was half an hour ahead of schedule.
