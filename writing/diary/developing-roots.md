An early start to a busy day. I was in the barbers at 7.30am before setting off to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) to help with an open day for local funders and organisations called Developing Roots.

We were expecting 50 people, so the first challenge was fitting all the cars on site. Luckily, our neighbour lend us their field for our cars so guests had the whole top area. We were anticipating being able to fit 15-17, and in the end we managed 21. This was only possible due to the huge amount of clearance that has happened at the top end of the site.

I gave a short talk on the Community days and then everyone had a chance to explore the site on their own.

I stayed down in the meadow to answer questions from people on the work we are doing to restore there.

Afterwards we had some workshop sessions to gather thoughts on how the organisations could use our site in their work.

Then a magnificent lunch cooked by a large support team from the community days.

In all, the day was hugely successful. It was the first time on site for many of the attendees, and they also valued the opportunity to network with others in the county.

By 2pm we had everything washed and cleaned up and I headed to the library for the first summer session of [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). Unfortunately there was a strange and major problem with the computers which meant we couldn't log on to the code sites we needed.

So, instead the children played chess and game sites which they were happy enough about. Hopefully the problem will be fixed before the club tomorrow.
