I had a few bitty tasks today for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). At 10am I had a catch up call with Pete about how we proceed with the paper based backup plan on the tree survey. I then went out to do the regular raft survey.

It was a very drizzly day and the trees in the distance looked distinctly autumnal. There were also deep cracks in the mud paths which is a far cry from the water logged fields of a couple of weeks back. Nothing major to report from the rafts, although it's encouraging that we keep seeing otter speint.

I then wandered over to Stroud to give my paperwork in for the DBS checks for the canal project. This will be a useful exercise to complete as I can then use it for other organisations like the library. It'll take a few weeks no doubt, but there's no rush.

In the afternoon, I went to the library for [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). Luckily the PCs were back to full operation after the shenanigans of last week. We had two new children this week, and they had to share a PC. So a total of nine. The remaining sessions this term are already booked out.
