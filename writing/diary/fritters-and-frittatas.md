During the summer months there's not so much maintenance work to do at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). Spent the morning hand clipping long grass from around the young hedge to let more light in.

I've never had a dull meal at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). The cooks are excellent and bring out the best of the fresh produce from the polytunnel.

We also have friends from Iran who love cooking and introducing us to their cuisine. Tahdig is a particular favourite - a bread cooked in the bottom of the rice pan.

A three course feast today. Leek soup to start. Rice, frittata, green salad and broad bean dip for main. And elder flower fritters for afters. Picked fresh from the tree, deep fried in batter and powdered in icing sugar.

In the afternoon, there was Code Club. Half term week, so only one boy turned up. But he's really taken to coding so it was a pleasure to be one on one and show him some new concepts. The library have also agreed their summer schedule funding, and we'll be allowed to continue running the code club over the holidays.

In the evening, the first gathering of the organisers for the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). We have a pretty good draft schedule of walks and leaders already, and a new person Graham joined our ranks to help. The main features this year will be long linear walks with coach drop off, a night walk and a family day at the [Dursley Sculpture Trail](http://www.visitthecotswolds.org.uk/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/family-days-out/dursley-sculpture-and-play-trail/).
