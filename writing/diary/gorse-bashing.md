Today the [Gloucestershire Vale Conservation Volunteers](http://www.gvcv.org.uk/) teamed up with the friends of Leckhampton Hill to tackle the gorse on the top of that hill.

This is the right time of year to be cutting back this prickly and thick vegetation. It clears a path along the top of the hill for the public.

But the grass banks to the side of the path are now more open and able to encourage wildflower growth there in the summer.

We normally work until 3pm, but the group we were with packed up at 12.30pm, so it was an early end to the task.
