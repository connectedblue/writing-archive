The summer was hot, mostly spent in the back garden. An old, green metal swing chair was erected at the bottom of the garden in front of the entrance to the woods behind. Impossibly uncomfortable and a trap for small fingers but we fought to sit on it.

A red climbing frame appeared that allowed you to see over the hedge into the neighbour's garden when you sat on the top.

It was the last Christmas where sacks of presents were at the bottom of our beds when we woke in the morning (the system would change the following year when they were wrapped under the tree instead). I had a monopoly set and Daniel had a ray gun which flashed and made a loud noise when you pulled the trigger.
