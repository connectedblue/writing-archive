Today was the regular monthly orchard work party for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). There's different tasks throughout the seasons, but winter is mostly about pruning.

The orchard is pretty old, the apple trees are 100+ years old and the pear are 250+. It was in a poor state when taken over by the wildlife trust a few years ago. It hadn't been tended for around 50 years. The trees were overgrown, covered in mistletoe and bramble had overgrown much of the in between.

Today however, after much work, the orchard looks fantastic and the trees have responded really well to prunes in previous years. We are lucky to have Tim from [Orchard Revival](https://orchardrevival.co.uk/) who provides the maintenance advice and techniques for looking after the trees. Fruit mainly grows on wood that is two, three or fours years old. Branches are best if the are horizontal from the main trunk.

I paired up with Louise and Caroline and we tackled an apple tree at the bottom of the Orchard.

It really took some time to look at the tangle of criss-crossing branches and decide which to cut and leave. We also focussed on the lower ones, not wanting to climb too high on the ladder for the moment.

We felt that we really freed up canopy and helped the remaining branches be as productive as possible. You have to avoid taking out more than a third of the weight of the tree, because it will cause stress. We still need to work on this, and perhaps the January session will be a good opportunity to continue the pruning work.

Meanwhile Matt was continuing to work on the shelter which [we started yesterday](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/11/gimme-shelter/). He made great progress getting the four uprights in place and securely tampered into the ground. We agreed to return next friday to carry on with the job.
