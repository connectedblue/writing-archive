Arrived at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) to open up today, as Martin and Vicky weren't around. The main task was to tidy up the top of the site to prepare for the [Severn Vale Art Trail](https://www.severnvalearttrail.org/) this weekend.

It was going to be just a bit of strimming, but I thought with Martin away it would be a good time to clear all the metal junk from the top of the site. I've had an injured arm lately, so luckily Ben was around to help with heavy lifting.

It took a fair bit of hauling about to see what was scrap and what needed saving. The basic idea was to clear the side of the shed, stack all the scaffold neatly, move stuff we wanted to keep like corrugated sheets, and throw away everything else.

After a final strim the site looked much better.

There was a good turnout today. The usual crowd plus Solveig's son and grandson, Woody. He came well prepared with wellies and gloves and helped to rake and plant the seeds.

Topped off with a really fabulous lunch ate on the benches in the sun for a change.

Code Club continues at the library, so a fun hour helping the children learn Scratch. We've had a few cancellations so I'll re-advertise as we have some spare computers that could be taken.

In the evening, it was the annual [town assembly](https://www.dursleytowncouncil.gov.uk/annual-assembly.html) which is a formal meeting to receive all the reports from the various community groups in the area. But always a good chance to network and catch up with people.

An interesting talk from the [Gloucestershire Community Rail Partnership](https://www.gloucestershirecommunityrail.org/) who talked about the weekend bus shuttle from the station over the summer. Will be a good way to connect visitors with the surrounding area.
