This week has been mostly about progressing various community projects I'm involved with.

On Tuesday and Thursday, I held the summer sessions for the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. The Thursday session has been web programming and the children are making remarkable progress at styling their sites they've been building the last couple of weeks.

On Thursday evening, I had a chance to catch up with Jo and we discussed different ideas for taking forward [Dursley Green Drinks](https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/).

Most days this week, I've also been working on the festival website for [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). It's nearly done, but there's still a few loose ends to tie up.

And Tuesday was also the regular Visit Dursley call, which happens every three months. This is a great way for local organisations to connect, share information and collaborate. On the back of that meeting, I've met with Zoe and Helen who will be producing some in store displays to support the walking festival. Also discussed with Nola how we can incorporate some events from the [Tyndale Arts Festival](https://www.tyndalearts.co.uk/) into our programme to cross promote.

And today I agreed the final shape of a mobile Escape Room that [The Engine](https://www.theengine.org.uk/) will provide as a special event on the sunday of the walking festival.
