A leisurely day today, with only the regular [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) raft check to do. The route to one of the rafts was inaccessible due to road closure, so I concentrated on the other two.

There was nothing remarkable to report on either raft - some otter speint on one and that was about it. However, one of the tributaries was immediately noticeable because it was covered completely in green duck weed - something I hadn't seen before.

I thought it was algae at first which would be a genuine concern and a possible sign of upstream pollution. However, it turned out to be duckweed, which is reasonably common, but definitely an infestation on this site.

It can cause oxygenation issues in the water over time, but there is very little to do about it at this time. I pass by this stretch every two weeks, so I'll keep a check.
