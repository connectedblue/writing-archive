A fabulous task and day with the [Gloucestershire Vale Conservation Volunteers](http://www.gvcv.org.uk/) at Elmley Castle, located at the very north tip of the Cotswolds.

It is a beautiful site, and one which GVCV have worked at many times before.

There were a few tasks, but I concentrated on the orchard which was terribly overgrown. A certain amount of pruning had been done with the chainsaw.

We had to clear the brash to a fire and them surgically shape the trees with the loppers. Jo from [Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group](https://www.fwagsw.org.uk/) was on hand with advice. She is also a director at the [Gloucestershire Orchard Trust](https://glosorchards.org/home/).

It was quite a transformation after a few hours work.

The trees are very old so are already shaped into their basic shape. But pruning the branches that were colliding and tangled means the new growth should be more structured.

Our hosts prepared a magnificent lunch in the barn at their farm. A venison lasagne from deer caught at the farm. And a veggie lasagne for me and the other vegetarians present.

The woodburner was on so the barn was very pleasant. Makes a change from egg sandwiches in the pouring rain.
