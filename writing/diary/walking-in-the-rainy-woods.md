We have organised a series of monthly walks with [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) in the run up to the festival in October. What we can't plan for is the weather though, and today looked ominous from the start as Storm Antoni battered the South West.

Richard was leading the walk, and we had six members of the public turn up. This type of weather puts off a lot of people, but with the right gear it doesn't really matter too much about the rain.

The first part was a reasonably gentle ascent of Stinchcombe hill. This was a route up there that I've not done before, so it's nice to add to the repertoire.

Normally there are fabulous views from the top, but today we quickly made our way down to Stinchcombe village and took a path through Piers Court and the church. From there, there's a familiar route that runs parallel with the motorway, but the way back to the start was again a route I was not familiar with.

So all in all, a successful walk and just goes to show that you shouldn't let the weather put you off a hike.
