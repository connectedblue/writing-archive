Heading off today for a week in Wales. It's an area I know reasonably well and looking forward to a week of walking.

The cottage is in a remote valley at the end of a remote village. The single track road leading in had scant passing spaces and 8 foot high hedgerows for about a mile and a half.

On the plus side, there was very little chance of actually meeting anyone.

The cottage is small, but well appointed. The weather is so warm, it feels like Italy. There are no sounds apart from birds and grazing sheep. An ideal base to explore the area from.
