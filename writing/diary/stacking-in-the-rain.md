The Friday fence project continued with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer), and the scrub clearance part entered the final 30m or so. There had been very heavy rain over the previous 48 hours, so it wasn't possible to drive the truck onto the reserve. So the day began with everyone lugging the tools needed by hand across to the work area.

The lower field has a huge gap with the neighbouring field. So, although stock proof fencing is being put in, I spent the first part of the morning piling cut material in the gap to make an additional dead hedge barrier.

The weather started out reasonable, and even sunshine for moments, but started to turn after the morning break.

I then turned my attention to raking the arisings which I had [brush cut last week](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/02/cutting-and-ramming/) in the lower meadow. This removes nutrient from the ground, which encourages more wild flowers and grasses. By cutting back the bramble, this should deliver another 100 square meters or so of grassland in the field.

By lunchtime the heavens really opened. It was a relentless downpour which showed no signs of stopping, so we decided to call it a day rather than have lunch. Overall my PPE held up well in the weather, although I noticed a hole in one wellington boot which led to wet socks. Maybe that's a repair I can make myself.
