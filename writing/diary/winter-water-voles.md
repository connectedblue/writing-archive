Time again for the fortnightly check of the river rafts for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). Only two today as the upturned one still hasn't been reset in the deeper waters upstream.

Possible otter sighting at the first raft and water vole on the second. This second one has been a consistent one for voles over the past six months, although today there were only very small signs - a handful of droppings.

There's not too much to see along the banks at the moment. The vegetation is very low since the growing season is some way off still. And birds seem to have deserted the area too for now.

In the afternoon I held another session of [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. A full house today with all eight PCs occupied and two new boys. Everyone pushed on with their projects at their own pace. A meeting with the library staff is scheduled for tomorrow where we'll look at the wider strategy of the code club over the remainder of the year.
