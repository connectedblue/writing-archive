Today I continued the task of removing the old tangled boundary hedge at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). The idea is to open up the whole side and then replant a native hedgerow and keep it managed.

A combination of rope and chainsaw allowed the dead elm to be felled which then made clearing the rest of the scrub with the brush cutter a lot easier.

For lunch a delicious hot spinach and potato soup with produce from the polytunnel.
