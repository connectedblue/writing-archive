It's getting close to the end of the season where plants drop their seeds. The wildflower patch I've been cultivating down the lane was pretty much finished and most of the seeds will have dropped in place.

I have a new set of seed to put there, in particular some knapweed from the garden and yellow rattle for the grassier areas.

September is the best time to put down seed, so I prepared the ground by cutting the vegetation as low as possible.

I then removed the material to keep the nutrient low.

In a week or so, I'll spread some seed and then wait until next year to see what comes up again.

In the evening I cooked the giant potato that I took home from wild acres on Tuesday. After baking in the microwave, I mixed the flesh with butter, cheese, mustard and pepper and grilled the result. A delicious supper.
