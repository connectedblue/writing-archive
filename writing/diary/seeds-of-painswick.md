Felt like a proper seed harvesting day again with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). The weather managed to just about hold clear, the meadow was brown and crispy and the hopper full each time.

We had some work experience students join us today to help out. Was really good to see their keen interest in the project and the environment.

The field produced a lot of yellow rattle, broom rape, red clover and knapweed.

Was also good to catch up with Anna on the survey data collection process. I'm designing an app which should reduce a lot of the manual work required to produce the botanical lists for clients.
