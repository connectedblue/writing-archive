It was the annual lantern festival, when the community gets together for a parade, a bonfire and some music. The road through the village was shut at 6pm which allowed a huge parade of people with lanterns to walk through to the Millennium Green.

The children were on holiday last week so were able to attend workshops to construct the lanterns.

This is the second year of the festival, and the lanterns were a lot more elaborate. It was hard to count, but there must have been more than 250.

After circling the top of the village the parade continued down to the Millennium Green.

That was the main place for the festival to start. There was food, a bonfire and music on a stage that lasted the rest of the evening. Despite wild weather predictions, it was both mild and rain free for the evening.
