The tour of Britain came through Dursley again. The weather was amazing and there was a bit of a build up for the town. Obviously they pass through very quickly, but they begin a big climb known as the mountain stage. The whole event is televised on ITV4 and it's interesting to see the footage of very familiar roads as they pass through heading our way.

In the evening I drove over to Gloucester with Martin and Amanda to attend an awards ceremony where [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) had been nominated in the Green Category.

It was a terrific evening, the weather was 30 degrees which is unheard of in September. But the cathedral provided a nice cool setting for the event.

Sadly, we didn't win the category but we picked up a commendation award which can be put into the office back at Wild Acres.
