I headed over to Chipping Sodbury this morning to have tea and brunch with my friend Jo. She opened a wool shop a while back but this is the first time I've visited.

It's called [The Wool Cellar](https://www.thewoolcellar.co.uk/) and it was fantastic to hear the story of how it has developed in the last few years. Retail is, of course, the toughest of trading environments but there are so many directions the business has gone in. It is somewhat niche (the nearest competitor is 20 miles away), but it caters for all ages from 6 to 95.

On top of all that, Jo also organises [The Sodbury Yarn Over](https://thesodburyyarnover.co.uk/) - a two day event in April which brings over 1400 people into the town.

Chipping Sodbury is a pretty thriving town and we spent a good couple of hours in one of the excellent cafes catching up.

So if you are local to this area, pop into the shop. Or if you need wool supplies, you can choose from the excellent range of products in [the online shop](https://www.thewoolcellar.co.uk/).
