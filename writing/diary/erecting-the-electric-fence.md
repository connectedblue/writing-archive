The goats are arriving this weekend at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), so today was a chance to put the electric fencing in place. It was a drizzling morning, but helped by Nick, we managed to stake out a full circuit of about of 170m of fencing.

It's not yet electrified, and it needs tensioning in places, but the basic install seems robust enough.

It's going to be important that this holds. If the goats escape the pen, they will cause havoc to the plants on the rest of the site.

Cherie cooked a really delicious lunch. I know I say this every week, but the taste of the meal today was really sensational.

In the afternoon, I headed down to the library for [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). The Tuesday club has dwindled to four, and I have eight PCs available. So tonight, I'm going to put a message on facebook to advertise the available slots in case any new children want to attend for the remainder of this term.

In the evening was the admin meeting for the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk). There's always a lot to catch up on, and keep on top of. But the survey programme is looking very strong this year and lots of new members have joined.
