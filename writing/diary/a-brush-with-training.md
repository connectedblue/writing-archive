It's been about three years since my last brush cutter training, so the [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) project paid for me and Chris to attend a day refresher training at the rural innovation centre of the [Royal Agricultural University](https://www.rau.ac.uk/for-business/rural-skills-courses/courses).

Although I use the brush cutter often, the last training was rather uninspiring. It was just after covid in an outdoor classroom on a freezing cold day. On top of that, the instructor was more keen on telling us how engines work rather than how to safely brush cut.

This course couldn't be more different. The facilities in the centre were excellent, and the instructor tailored the material to the most important aspects.

One thing we covered in detail are the legal and liability aspects of operating this equipment in a work environment.

The main new skill I picked up was how to start it properly. I always struggle to get them going, and apparently the technique I was taught last time was wrong. It should be enough to prime the engine, then pull the cord. The choke should only be used if that doesn't work.

I passed the course so I will get my [LANTRA](https://www.lantra.co.uk/) skills card updated. This is necessary to present to any organisation that I will be doing brush cutting in the future with.
