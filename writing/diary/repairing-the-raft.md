I met with Pete from the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) at 10am to work on repairing a monitoring raft that overturned just before Christmas. The river has been far to high to safely go in and sort out. The clay cartridge and oasis was lost so a new one needed to be prepared.

In the end, it was pretty easy to sort it out. A tree had fallen on the raft and tangled the guy rope. With Pete on the bank, I was able to lift it out and he levered it onto land.

We then had a discussion about the tree survey, and hatched a plan to make it easier to collect in the field for surveyors. I then went off to check the other two rafts, as I do every fortnight. There were potential water vole signs at one, and none at the other.

In the afternoon, I held the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. All eight PCs were in use, and everyone worked on a variety of projects, from scratch to python to web pages.

In the evening, we held the AGM for [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). There was a potential organisation issue due to a member standing down which would have impacted this year's [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). However, two people stepped forward to fill the roles, and planning can commence as usual over the summer.
