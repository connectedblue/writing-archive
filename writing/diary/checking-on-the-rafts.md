There's not a lot been spotted recently on my river raft checks for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). It's well outside the breeding season, and the bank vegetation has been cut back by the Environment Agency, so maybe not altogether surprising.

There was signs of an otter on one raft, so that is encouraging. But earlier in the year I was seeing signs on all three rafts regularly. Will be interesting to see if it picks up over winter.

The river level was very high today after the recent rains. It's over knee height in one place, so I may not be able to continue doing that safely over the next few weeks if the rain continues.
