An early start turned out also to be an early mistake. The email from the [Crickhowell Walking Festival](https://www.crickhowellfestival.com/) contained tickets for the Saturday and Sunday walk, but in reverse order so the Sunday walk was first. This meant going to the wrong place on the other side of the national park and wondering why no walk leader was there.

When I realised the mistake I had about half an hour to travel the 35 minutes to meet the actual Saturday Group. I managed the journey in 25 minutes and somehow were not the last ones to show.

The route ascended quite quickly to the ridge which dominates the landscape behind the town of Crickhowell. We were a small, but friendly group and lots of conversations started on the way up.

After the mid morning break, we finally reached the ridge, from where the walk to the top of Pen Alt Mawr was relatively easy.

We descended to the valley on the other side, which I must have done before, but I didn't recognise it. We skirted the valley floor, around the shoulder of Pen Cerrig-calch and ascended up to table mountain before descending to the town.

An excellent 12 mile route, and served as a good re-introduction to the area again.
