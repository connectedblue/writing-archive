I attended a climate and community conference today representing [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). It was hosted by [FWAG South West](https://www.fwagsw.org.uk/) and I only found out about it a couple of days ago. It turns out that Kathy was also going so we lift shared up to the venue in Cheltenham.

It turned out to be a timely event and I managed to connect a few things together which I'm aware of. I knew a few of the FWAG people, having worked with them on habitat management projects in the past. But it was interesting also to meet people from Transition Stroud and Gloucestershire Rural Community Council.

The main topics were about how community groups can act in a co-ordinated way to deliver projects that meet climate targets. It turns out that there are a lot of county and national initiatives which can support individual community organisations with advice, funding, information and other support.

I was able to connect some people who I know with relevant projects to some of the attendees today. As with all networking, who knows what will come of the connection, but everything is generally additive and just helps to bring community groups closer together.
