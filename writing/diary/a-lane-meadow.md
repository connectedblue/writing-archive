The patch down the side of my house is ideal for wild flowers. For years it was covered in nettles and ivy. A while back, a few neighbours got together to try and manage it a bit. Most of the scrub was cut back, the ash pruned and the bushes trimmed.

I started to throw down wildflower seeds in the rougher ground, which should be ideal, but it always got overgrown with broad leaf vegetation.

But this year there has been success.

There are about 7 or 8 yellow rattle plants growing in the grass along with self heal, red clover and others. Hopefully the seed from these will sustain this patch from now on. Just a cut in late season and early next should be enough.
