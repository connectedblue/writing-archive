It's very unusual to be seed harvesting at this time of year. But the hot weather combined with the poor harvest at the beginning meant we went one more time today. Harvey called me a couple of days ago, and I re-scheduled something to go along and help him.

We met at Northleach and went to the barns to tidy up a few things and pick up the kit.

The sites today were field margins rather than full fields. So it was a bit fiddly having to keep setting up and breaking camp in different locations.

One thing that you can only do at this time was hand harvest yarrow. This is a very late seeding plant, and the seed heads don't yield easily. However, in the last site an awful lot had gone to seed, so I went around with a bucket to collect some by hand.

In the end, we collected 8kg, which was not a great haul really. We went back to the barns and laid everything out for the last time. It was also a time to get the scarifier out ready for seed spreading next week.
