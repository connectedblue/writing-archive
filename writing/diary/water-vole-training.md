The [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) organised a one day course about water vole monitoring. A number of volunteers from the trust and the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk) attended.

The course was run by Emily from the [People's Trust for Endangered Species](https://ptes.org/campaigns/water-voles/). A very high quality course with lots of information on field signs, threats, monitoring and their role in the environment.

Water voles have declined over 80% in the last 50 years, and a lot of work is going to preserve where they can be found. This includes the Stroud Water Canal restoration.

You can register online as a [water vole surveyor](https://watervoles.ptes.org/auth/register) and participate in the national monitoring programme
