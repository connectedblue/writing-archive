Another challenging start to a day of seed harvesting with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). We met up at 9.30am at the designated site but it became clear that the field was not yet ready to yield its seed. The bird's foot trefoil was in full flower, along with the field scabious.

We decamped to another site close by which was on schedule for tomorrow and this was in much better shape.

No other volunteers showed up today so I was on my own to sieve and dry the seed while Harvey harvested.

It turned out to be a good haul. There was a lot of grass on each load, but tons of seed mixed in.

The gamekeeper Dean told us about another nearby field at lunch time and that proved even better. Hardly any grass and a dense collection of species rich seed.

There was a lot of wooly thistle in this field. It's a comparatively rare plant, although often seen on the calcareous grasslands of the Cotswolds. It's a large plant and the heads were in flower. They attract a lot of pollinators.

Total haul for the day was 22kg, which is pretty good for this season.
