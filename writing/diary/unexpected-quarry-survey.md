The original plan today was a straightforward seed restoration with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). We usually do these in September or early October, but April is also a possible window too.

The site today was one we had done previously and we were going to extend the bank further. However, there was a mix up with the land staff and the area we were targetting was not prepared. It is a man made bank, but there was no topsoil added yet, so wholly unsuitable for seeding.

So instead we took a walk up Leckhampton hill to a quarry and looked for calcareous grassland indicator species.

It's also educational to go on a survey trip with Anna. Steep quarry banks usually harbour these species because they are unimproved habitats.

And it didn't disappoint. Among the usual species, we also found mouse-ear hawkweed, horseshoe vetch and a hawkweed which couldn't be readily identified without consulting a botany book.

In the evening we had the monthly [Dursley Green Drinks](https://dursleygreen.org.uk/dursley-green-drinks/) at Kingshill House. About 15 attended which was a smaller number than usual, but still some new faces and good conversations taking place.
