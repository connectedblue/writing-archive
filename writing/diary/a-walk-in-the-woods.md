Took a detour up into the woods to look at the spring flowers. Wild garlic, bluebells and wood anemones were the highlight.

Wasn't really expecting to meet anyone on a Thursday morning, but it's always a surprise how few people use these paths. Fine example of beech trees, and sadly fewer ash than this time last year.
