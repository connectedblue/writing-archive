Today was the launch of the [Dursley Green Hub](https://hub.dursleygreen.org.uk) which is grew out of the WhatsApp group for [Dursley Green Drinks](https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/). Hopefully this will become a more scalable way to connect and exchange information locally about sustainability and other related issues.

The software underneath is pretty nice, it's called [Flarum](https://flarum.org/) and is open source and very configurable. Was also very easy to install on my shared hosting, so hopefully this will be relatively easy to administer. 17 people joined in the first day, so that was pretty good.

In the afternoon I had [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). It is half term which meant only two children came along. But it turned out to be highly productive as I was able to give them full attention. They made quite significant progress on understanding variables, so hopefully they can take that forward. It's quite hard to give this level of focus when there are 8 present.

I also got an email from Gerry who is keen to start volunteering at Code Club. This is good news, because there more there are of us, we can offer different types of service.
