Most of my hikes start from the doorstep. But it's nice to start further out and explore a wider circle. Parking in the centre of Dursley allows a magnificent 11 mile circular up and over to Wotton-Under-Edge.

Up and over Stinchcombe following the [Cotswolds Way](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/cotswold-way/), soon leads to a prominent local landmark - the North Nibley tower.

It's been a while since I walked this route and it has opened up considerably due to a lot of ash tree removal.

The celadine was in full bloom, covering almost every field margin and under hedgerow.

The prominent tree cluster overlooking Wotton is a striking landmark, but the view was somewhat misty, even by late morning.

Returning back was a larger than expected climb, but once you have threaded through the wood after the Old London Road, you are rewarded with a view over one of the loveliest hidden valleys in the area.
