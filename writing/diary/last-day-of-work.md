It was a blazing hot day, as it had been the last few weeks, and I left Pure Planet for the last time around 5pm. I walked up the hill through Bath to the top where I parked my car, and experienced a feeling that my life was about to fundamentally change, although I did not know quite how.

There was no send off of any sort. Everyone was expecting me to return in 7 months after a period of sabbatical. My main feeling was one of relief. I had finished a major project on direct debit reviews and just wanted to forget about work for a while.

By this point, the only reason to carry on working was to get money. And I didn't need more money. I was burning out. I didn't know if I wanted to have two months or two years away from work (the sabbatical turned out to be a compromise with my employer who didn't want me to resign fully as I had back in May).

I would shortly be 51, and had a deep feeling that I wanted to traverse my fifties on my own terms, whatever that may mean. I had completed exactly 29 years of career [since my first day of work](https://diary.uncountable.uk/1990/09/first-day-of-work/). I found it long, varied and fulfilling but didn't really feel like putting in another 11 just to make a nice round number.

I don't even have a photograph from this day. It was as unremarkable as most of the previous 29 years working days.
