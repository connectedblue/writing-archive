I had brush cut quite a few areas at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) recently, but the clippings had not been cleared. So today was a good opportunity to catch up on completing the job.

The first area to tackle was the path along the brook. This is in much better shape than ever now, with the overhead obstacles cleared and the pathway cut to the end. But it was still unsteady underfoot because the cut vegetation was still deep on the ground and masked issues like trip hazards.

I was joined by Stacey, David and Mikey. David and Mikey were on school holidays, and were very keen to help with the work. We used a variety of different rakes to shift the material away from the main path and get it down to mud. David made an excellent habitat pile by the side of the path for creatures to make a home in.

Cherie cooked us lunch which was potatoes and mung bean fritters with fresh beans and salad from the polytunnel.

There was some controversy over the mung beans which I didn't fully understand because they were delicious.

I also cleared the area by the dead hedge which I had brush cut a few weeks ago. That is going to be covered in some thick material to prevent vegetation regrowing, although it's not clear at the moment what the long term use for that corner will be.

I topped up the goats hay and water and headed home at a leisurely pace. No code club at the moment die to school holidays, so no need to rush back after lunch.
