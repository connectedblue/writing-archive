A chance to visit a place in the news recently with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). The Heavens is a beautiful area of the Stroud Valleys, and a part of it was put up for sale by the landowner. There is a [community action project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/news/community-move-to-protect-the-heavens) to try and acquire it.

This meadow is in the far corner of the Heavens and has been harvested by the project for a number of years, although this is the first time I have visited the site. Sarah and I met up with Tom at the rather awkward entrance and checked out the plan for the day.

There was a lot of knapweed just coming into seed, but it's very difficult to catch in the harvester. So we decided to brush fairly low to catch the yellow rattle, red clover, St John's wort and numerous other species that were in seed.

It was a baking day again, but there was shade and a breeze which made it more pleasant.

I had thought that the longer sward might slow Tom down, but it didn't seem to. As is common with all the harvests this year, two people sifting a load can't complete the previous batch before the next one lands. So we ended up with a huge tarpaulin of seed again.

There was a public footpath running through the site which is always a good opportunity to engage with members of the public about what we do. The nice thing about this project is, even in this divisive and divided world, I've yet to come across anyone who isn't onboard with restoring more wildflower grasslands in the Cotswolds.

It was only a small meadow so the main harvest was complete by lunchtime. We ate our lunch in a shady corner of the meadow and the conversation ranged from the three domains of life to infinite parallel universes.

After lunch we did some hand harvesting to concentrate on the knapweed and field scabious. This obviously pulls a much smaller yield than the machine (no more than a bagful really), but it's a targetted way to get particular species.

Even when hand harvesting you can just knock the knapweed and the seed goes everywhere, so you can see the problem trying to collect it in the harvester.

Another very pleasant day in a stunning location.
