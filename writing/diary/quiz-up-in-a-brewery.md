It was the annual fund raising quiz night for [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/). It was held in the upstairs room at [Stroud Brewery](https://stroudbrewery.co.uk/). I was on a table of six with other volunteers on the canal project.

There were six rounds of quiz, with a raffle and a group quick fire round where the last person standing wins.

Our team name was the Hedge Hugs, with the play on words a reference to the hedge we have been taking care of over the last year.

We did surprisingly well, coming third overall. We were just half a point behind second place. It turned out we were a kingfisher's leg colour away from taking second spot. We said red, when the answer is orange.

It was an excellent night overall - good food, company and entertainment.
