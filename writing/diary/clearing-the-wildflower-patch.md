The outdoor habitat management is well underway now at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). It's a good time of year to cut down seeded wildflowers as well as the encroaching bramble and other vegetation. I focused on the patches at the top and next to the kitchen and had help to clear the cut material - essential to remove nutrient from the soil.

One of our friends from Iran is an expert steel worker and he took the angle grinder to the blunt brush cutter blade and shaped a super sharp cutting edge. Makes the job easier and so much quicker as everything was a clean low cut like butter.

We were treated at lunchtime to the most amazing dish, cooked by Iranian chefs. The heart was an aubergine and egg dish, but served with pasta, salad and other vegetables. The fresh chilli was hot put perfectly complimented the flavours of the dish.

In the afternoon, I had Code Club. A full session again, and every child had been to previous ones so they continued with their projects. I'm always astonished at not only how quickly they absorb the concepts, but how creative they are in their programs.

I gave the dates of some Monday sessions for python and web for the older age groups. There's been a lot of demand for this, so when the library have created the booking links, I'll forward on to my email list.
