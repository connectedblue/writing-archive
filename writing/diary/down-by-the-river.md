Decided to check the rafts a day early, as heavy rain is expected tomorrow - washing away the signs we are looking for. This is an ongoing project for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) to monitor for small mammals along the waterways.

It's always a pleasant walk to the three locations. The scene changes with the season, and not surprisingly the wildflowers are abundant everywhere.

This section of the bank does not have public access which helps to keep everything undisturbed.

The possible water vole sighting I made a few weeks ago was confirmed today with a substantial latrine on the raft.

We are just entering their breeding season so one to watch closely.

There's a magnificent row of black poplar which were in full leaf for the first time this year. When you stand underneath they make a distinctive whooshing sound as the wind filters through the leaves.
