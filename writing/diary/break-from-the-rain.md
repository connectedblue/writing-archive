The last few days have been rainy, and no work parties scheduled. There's only so much admin you can catch up on, so this morning I took a walk in between the showers.

This route is a regular circular, but one that changes dramatically with the seasons.

The climb up to the top of the woods was along a heavily overgrown path, which meant I got soaking wet from the still wet plants.

One thing which stood out were the pastures that hadn't been grazed this year. Some were cut for hay, but others were taken over by docks and creeping thistle. Will be interesting to see whether these pastures recover next year, and what land management practices will be applied
