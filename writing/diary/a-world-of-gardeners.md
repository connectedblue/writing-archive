Something a bit different today. Drove up the the NEC to attend the Gardener's World expo. The weather was a bit dicey, and the M42 traffic was extremely heavy, but got there around 11am to look around.

The show was both indoors and outdoors. Most of the competition entries were outside, while the traders and exhibitors were in the conference hall.

The gardens were great. Like little pieces of mini artworks, they also showcase what can be done with a small space.

It seems that no visit to the show is complete without purchasing a lot of plants and the guys selling the drag along trolleys to put them in did a brisk trade. The stands I was most disappointed by were the RSPB, woodland trust and Plant Life. They were intent only on selling memberships and it was impossible to get any information about their projects. I wrote [an open letter](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/an-open-letter/) to all three organisations to express my disappointment at this lost opportunity to engage the public about conservation.

It was great to see wheelbarrow entries from a lot of primary schools around the country. Getting children involved in a show like this is a great way to engage with nature.
