Travelled up to the North Cotswolds today for a task with the [Gloucestershire Vale Conservation Volunteers](http://www.gvcv.org.uk/). More himalayan balsam pulling, this time in the beautiful wooded [John Moore Nature Reserve](http://www.kemerton.org/wildlife_sites_john_moore.htm) in Kemerton.

It's only a small site, with just a small stream flowing through. But there was quite a bit of balsam in the middle of the wooded area.

The previous night there had been a very severe hailstorm and all the vegetation was flat on the floor. Quite an unusual site, and make the pulling a bit trickier.

There were around 8 of us, so we made short work of the main task during the morning. There was also a few nettle patches which the ranger wanted clearing so a smaller team stayed on to do that.

There was an Edward VII post box near the parking area - something which you don't come across all that often.
