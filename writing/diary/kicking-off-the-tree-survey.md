The [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) are restarting the tree survey along the canal on behalf of the canal company. We had some [training a couple of weeks ago](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/02/inspecting-trees/), and this was the first opportunity to get everyone together and familiar with the app we will use to record the results.

We didn't get off to a good start as the entire road to the start point of the survey was closed. So we hastily reconvened at Fromebridge Mill and made our way to occupation bridge to use the app.

I put together a google maps based form so that you can locate each nearby tree record and update it from the pin.

It turned out that iPhones didn't really work very well with this system. There are six of us doing the survey, and three have android, so we can just about get into pairs with one working phone. But it's not ideal, so I'll continue to see if there's a better way to handle the survey on iphones.

It seems that most people would prefer Mondays or Fridays to do surveys, so we'll set up a spreadsheet to schedule the starts.
