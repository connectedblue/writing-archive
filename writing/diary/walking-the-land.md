I met up with Ruth and Lucy from [Walking the land](https://walkingtheland.org.uk/) - a Stroud based art group who do walks and draw/paint in the landscape. They contacted me earlier this year as they want to host their October walk in Dursley during the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/).

I showed them a few routes centred around the [Dursley Sculpture Trail](http://www.visitthecotswolds.org.uk/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/family-days-out/dursley-sculpture-and-play-trail/) at Twinberrow woods. They will walk up to breakheart quarry, back down to Ashen Plain Wood and then enter the sculpture trail from the far end.

They usually stop 2-3 times for 20 minutes or so to paint and draw. This should be an excellent route as there are many nice viewpoints along the way.

In the afternoon, I continued with some festival admin, and then started to look at creating the Tree Resurvey app which needs to be built before the first session next week.
