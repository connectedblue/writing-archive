Well, I had worked ad-hoc every year since 1984, but today was the official day one of my actual career. I had graduated with a 2:1, which was a condition for me starting at R Watson & Sons as an Unqualified Actuarial Assistant.

I had somehow blagged this job at a prestigious private partnership on a salary of £15,000 plus Christmas bonus of £800. And on qualification within three years, this would rise to a minimum of £36,000. An incredible amount of money for someone who had no experience of anything (I didn't qualify in the end, left that role in 1993 and it was the end of the decade before my salary would reach that dizzying level).

Still, that first day was full of promise. I had a new Marks and Spencer suit with a suitable array of floral ties which were all the fashion back then. I met my 21 fellow unqualified assistants for the first time as we gathered in the board room for a briefing of what to expect over that first year.

It was really just an extension of university but with money. We were all the same age and it was the first day at work for everyone. We'd all taken digs in various locations around Reigate. One or two had partners and cars, but otherwise we were young, free, single and loaded.

We were expected to study, but were given time off to do so. We'd be rotated around various departments to learn the business. There was a great canteen so no need to cook in the evening. Compared to other options, I had landed a pretty good gig.

We went down to the Wine Bar after work where the lager was £1.80 a pint. Something I wouldn't have dreamed of paying earlier in the summer. But today, it felt like pocket change. Twenty suited twenty-somethings drinking expensive lager at a wine bar in an upmarket suburban town must have looked like the worst excesses of the eighties were here to stay. I certainly hoped so.

One point of note. I arrived on crutches due to having had pins removed over the summer from [my previous caving accident](https://diary.uncountable.uk/1989/04/caving-accident/). I don't remember exactly how long I had them for, but it was a few weeks I was hobbling around the office for.
