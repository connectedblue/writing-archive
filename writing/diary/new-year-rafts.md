The festive season is coming to a close, and it's good to have the regular activities restarting this week. Today was the regular raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer).

I normally do three sites, but one is out of commission at the moment since the high waters overturned the raft. Once it is safe to enter the water again, I'll go down with Pete and fix it.

The other two sites were quiet. There was otter speint on one which is encouraging and footprints on both cartridges, although it wasn't really possible to know if they were rat or water vole.
