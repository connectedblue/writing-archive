Following [yesterday's](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/08/checking-on-the-mill-fly/) trigger alert, I met with Tony again at 8.30 to redo the riverfly sample.

We swapped roles today to remove any variance in the sampling method and we were super careful to make sure we got a variety of habitat into the net.

Again, it didn't look promising when we emptied into the bucket and started analysing.

There were slightly more gammarus than yesterday, but no other species apart from a caseless caddis I found. We spent an extra amount of time careful going through the sample, to see if there was a olive or something else.

Because there were over hundred gammarus, this increased the score to 4 compared to yesterday. But it felt like the same result. An area which has been species rich in the past is pretty depleted.

We decided to do a second sample about 100m upstream. Not as part of the formal data submission, because that is not a registered site, but just to get an idea. The good news on that sample was we picked a few other species out - not huge numbers but they were definitely present. There were over 1,500 gammarus which would have made the score 7.

When I entered the official site score later on, there was no longer a trigger on the system. So for now, it seems everything might be stable. But this is an area we'll keep a close eye on, and other people in our local group will be sampling different parts of the river over the next few weeks.
