It was the May bank holiday meet for the caving club. So as well as the regular, current members, we'd be joined by some previous members in a dinner in Settle on the Sunday night. Always a raucous affair, we'd have a private dining room, drink until the early hours and sleep on the pub floor in sleeping bags.

So that morning was an easy trip that we could finish well before we were due in Settle. I was to lead it and was accompanied by Clive, Tim and Wendy. The cave was Bull Pot - an easy cave in the Kingsdale valley that was often done with beginners to get them used to the experience.

Clive had his camera which was unusual. Mostly we didn't take cameras with us because it's too delicate to use casually underground. Of course this is many, many years before the advent of camera phones (or even mobiles in general).

We parked in the usual spot at the bottom of the valley and walked up with all the gear about half way up the hill where the cave entrance was located.

I had only led a couple of trips before so was still learning the techniques from Clive and Tim who were much more experienced.

I spent quite a while setting up the rope access at the entrance so that we would have a clean descent down the first pitch.

Once everything was in place, I was happy to go first and drop in so the others could follow me. At the bottom I yelled up so the next person could follow and went to find the top of the second pitch which was just below a boulder scramble at the bottom of the first.

I could hear the next person coming down so I carefully tried to find the pitch head. I took a wrong turn and ended up in a choked passage where I could go no further. I turned around to come back but I was at a slightly higher level shuffling back than I was going into the choke. I put a foot forward and felt no solid rock underneath.

Next thing I know, I'm lying on my back in a stream, no light and pitched darkness. My right leg hurts like hell and I can't see a thing. I start yelling and soon I see pin pricks of light high above. It was clear I had fallen 10m down the second pitch.

The other three sprang into action to start a rescue attempt. Clive had a pulley with him so a system of ropes could be rigged which would allow me to be hauled up. I lost track of time and activity going on but Clive, Tim and Wendy were just amazingly resourceful and skilled in getting everything ready for hauling me up that first pitch.

They managed to get me to the top of the pitch I'd fallen down. I then had to hop on my good leg with Wendy holding my broken ankle boot steady. It was slow and painful, but adrenaline got me into position to be hauled up to the entrance.

I don't really remember that final ascent or swinging into place at the top of the pitch. By now I was in extreme pain.

Once I was safely out, only then could Tim go off to the call box and telephone for help. It's hard to remember what life was like before mobile phones, but in a situation like this, there was no instant mechanism to get assistance.

The ambulance team arrived after a while and strapped me with a temporary splint. A team of passing Yugoslavian cavers was enlisted to carry me down to the waiting ambulance and Clive accompanied me to the hospital at Lancaster.

Needless to say, this was a very stressful day. It was around five or six hours between the accident and being inside the A & E department in the hospital. An X-ray revealed I had broken both the tibia and fibula just above the ankle.

I was scheduled to have an operation the next day when several pins were put inside my leg and I remained in hospital for about a week longer. I went back to university for the exam period and remained in plaster for four months after. The following year I had another operation to remove the pins and was in plaster again for three months following that.

I'm forever grateful to Wendy, Clive and Tim whose quick thinking and expertise both saved my life that day and prevented long term, life changing injury.
