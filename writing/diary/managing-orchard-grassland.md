In the summer, there's not too much tree care to do in the orchard, so the attention of the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) monthly orchard party turned to the grass. We have done [work in the past](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/08/barbecue-and-thistle/) to deal with encroaching thistle and it really showed this year. Although present in places, it was nowhere near as dominant as last year.

The plan today was to cut back some species from the middle of the orchard to allow the grassland to thrive.

The main focus was nettle, creeping thistle and dock before they set seed. Some people used scythes, others pulled by hand and Mike and I took in turns with the brush cutter.

It's hard to remember that just three years ago, large parts of the orchard centre were covered in bramble patches above head height. So although we have to keep on top of it, the grassland is dramatically improving. It was also good to see what the cattle have grazed also, although they are too fussy to have a go at the dock and nettle patches.

There's not a great species abundance here, but the meadow buttercup is starting to spread. It'll take many years for the nutrient levels to come down to the point where dominant grasses don't have such a free reign.
