Second day in a row for monitoring river fly. This time at the Ebley site with Tony. Like [yesterday](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/08/sampling-sunday/), there was a concern for what we might find after the upstream pollution event last week.

However, today was a woeful haul. Even before we got onto the bank to analyse we could see there wasn't a lot swimming around in the bucket. We set to work, and counted the gammarus, which was very low at around 80. But the only other species we could find was a tiny cased caddis.

So the overall score was a 3, which is below the trigger level for the site. When I entered it into the system that afternoon, the system asked if we can repeat the survey in the next 48 hours. I contacted Tony and we agreed to meet tomorrow at 8.30am and do the sample again.
