Drove up to a site north of Stow for a day of harvesting with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). This field had been restored a few years ago by the project, so it's great to see it already in a condition where seed can be collected.

It was just myself and Lorna today, so the morning was pretty full on with the early rounds of harvesting the lower sward parts of the field.

The field was pretty abundant in yellow rattle, however we weren't collecting very much.

The brush height was adjusted and more seed pods were picked up, but not a lot of seed. We concluded that most of it had already dropped into the field.

There was a lot of ribwort plantain and red clover, as well as sweet vernal grass. So it was a pretty good haul despite the lack of yellow rattle. We finished just after lunch because the longer grass was impossible to get the harvester through, and was mostly only grasses anyway.

We headed back to the barns to lay out the seed to dry for a few more days. The humid weather has meant even hauls from a week ago have not dried yet, so space is at a premium now in the barns. Hopefully over the next few days, the earlier seeds will be completely dry and can be packed away.

In the evening, it was a meeting of the town environmental land management committee, which is making steady progress towards completion of the management plans for various council owned green spaces.
