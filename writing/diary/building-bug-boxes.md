Went up to Cainscross today to help [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/) build some bug box kits for children's activities. They have a beautiful workshop there, well stocked with tools for the job.

The first task was to break a wooden palette into enough smaller pieces to then assemble. This is not easy, but a combination of circular saw with claw hammer separated the parts we needed.

Each box has a base, two sides, a back and sloping roof. Everything is held together with screws.

Once we had a template design, we fashioned five bundles together ready for assembly.

After lunch, it was then relatively easy to screw them together, then disassemble again into kits.

There were only three of us, but we managed to make five boxes in the sweltering workshop. Jo also cut many garden canes into small cigarette sized pieces which can be stacked inside the box to make the bug hotel.

This is for an activity which Stroud Valley's Projects are holding in a couple of weeks to get children engaged with nature.

In the evening there was another Dursley Green Drinks at [Kingshill House](https://www.kingshillhouse.org.uk/). A different crowd to the one last month turned out and this gave a different flavour again. There seems to be broad support for this group to meet going forward.
