Up early this morning to join the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk) for a 6am Dawn Chorus at Ebworth. This was led by Jen, who knows the area well and is very knowledgeable on bird calls and song.

It was a perfectly sublime start to the day. The sky was blue and sunny, and the beech tree leaves glowed in the morning light. There were so many species that we could hear in different parts of the wood. Robin, wren, goldcrest, blackcap, willow warbler, great tit, coal tit, chiffchaff, blue tit, linnet and song thrush.

We were also able to observe quite a few with binoculars, especially in the open common areas.

We stopped for breakfast after about an hour then wandered back to the car park, still able to hear many different birds.

As a bonus, we walked through St George's meadow which was full of cowslips in flower and many other species waiting to burst through. Early purple orchids were also spotted.

Very well worth getting up early for.

Later in the morning, I headed to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) to drop off 500 wildflower plug plants which we will plant next week. They are floodplain plant species acquired from the [Flourishing Floodplains](https://www.wwt.org.uk/our-work/projects/flourishing-floodplains/) project and will greatly help to restore the meadow/

The Severn Vale Art trail is on at the moment and Wild Acres is a venue for displaying art on the trail
