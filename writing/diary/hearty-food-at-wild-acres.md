I continued meadow maintenance today at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). The grass will be cut shortly with the tractor, so I cut a space next to the new hedge with the brush cutter. This will help the tractor to avoid destroying the hedge by getting too close.

The strimmer head for the brush cutter was broken, so I used the tri blade instead. It wasn't particularly efficient because the long grass kept tangling around the blade and stopping it from rotating. So I had to frequently stop and clean up.

There was a lot of horsetail and dominant grasses in this part of the meadow. Hopefully over the coming years we can encourage more wild flowers.

The lunch today from Cherie was utterly delicious. The food is always consistently high quality but today was exceptional. We started with thick, fresh tomato soup and then a main of butternut squash, cheese and onion pie with beans, vegetables and yoghurt sauce.

In the afternoon, I held another session of the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). We had five children today - unfortunately two were caught up in the flight delays following the national air traffic problems yesterday. Martin joined me, who I met last week and will assist with the clubs going forward.

Afterwards, I met up with Tessa and Fran from the library management team to discuss how the code club can contribute to wider community initiatives going forward. It was also useful to discuss what we could do with specific funding, if some should become available in the future.
