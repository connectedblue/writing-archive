A few things on my agenda today so I set out early for the regular river raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). At this time of year, mink can be on the move, so we need to be vigilant.

One of the rafts had clear otter prints again - I've been consistently seeing them for the last several months so a good sign of river health on this stretch. The other two rafts had a few inconclusive signs, so I logged possible sightings.

After lunch, I headed to the library to meet Fran to discuss a recent grant we have been awarded for the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). It's a significant amount of money, and we were able to order some much needed equipment to introduce the children to different aspects of computing. We made a parts list online, but there are a number of hurdles to cross internally with the procurement process. It's likely to be several weeks before equipment arrives, but we can then plan how to incorporate it into the autumn term clubs.

In the evening I had a call with Graham to discuss the programme for the October [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). I need to start building the website now as we'll be releasing the programme at the end of the month. I have enough to get going for the moment, but there is still quite a bit of detail to flesh out on some of the walks.
