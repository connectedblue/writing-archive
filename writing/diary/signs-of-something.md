One of the rafts I monitor regularly for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) has been showing consistent signs of habitation over the last few months.

I was pretty convinced earlier it was water voles - it was small and trampled like their latrines.

But today I'm not so sure. There was a lot of activity but it looks like something else.

I'll check to see if there's a spare camera trap and we can set it up and get a good look at who's visiting.
