The cow parsley struck me today. It was everywhere, seemingly all of a sudden. All the borders and hedgerows were full of the flowers, all at the same height.

I was late setting out. A number of emails have started to trickle in about the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) and I like to keep on top of them during this planning stage.

It also took longer because I couldn't help stopping to identify various plants I could see.

Popped into the [Chantry Centre](https://www.chantrycentre.org/) for tea and cakes. It was a sunny day, and the garden was the perfect place to sit.

Was busy for a Wednesday. I recognised a few people from the various projects I'm involved with.

In the afternoon, I had a call with Dave from [Ashen Plains Campsite](https://ashenplains.co.uk/). He had a number of great ideas about how to link his accommodation and transport options with walk routes and the town. He has a shepherd hut for hire, so we could advertise that on the [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) website.
