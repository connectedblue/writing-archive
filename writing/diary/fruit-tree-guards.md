The monthly orchard work party with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) was taken up with constructing five new stock proof tree guards to house new pear trees and protect from grazing cattle.

The first task was to manually haul all the gear from the truck parked in a nearby estate into the orchard. Unfortunately the downpours of the last few days make it impossible for even a 4x4 to drive over the fields. But there were quite a few of us, and it only took a few trips each to get all the wood and tools that were needed.

I did a [similar task last year](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/03/planting-and-protecting-trees/) and we repeated the same design. Four tall posts, three rails and two pieces of barb. All about 1.5m square which should prevent the cows from accessing the young trees.

It took a little while to get the four upright posts. The orchard is on a slope, so it's never going to "look square". But we were careful with the spirit level to make sure the uprights were perpendicular to the ground. The top set of rails were attached first to get it stable and the next two quickly followed.

In all, there were five guards completed by the team, which was a super fast effort. The barb is not yet in place, but that's a really quick job.

Very warm today, especially compared with the last few days. It was tee shirt weather to work in and it stayed dry.
