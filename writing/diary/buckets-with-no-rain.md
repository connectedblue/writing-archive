The regular orchard work party with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) began with a watering activity. We were all asked to bring buckets so we could water the new hedge planted at the top, along with the fruit trees recently planted.

Luckily there were quite a few of us, and although it was quite a trek to the top of the orchard from the canal, we managed to get the hedge done quite quickly.

The newer fruit trees are all inside stock proof fencing and all needed a good drink too.

It was a hot day, so we took frequent breaks. At one point we visited the small meadow on the other side of the reserve which I've not been to before. It turns out that it's extremely species rich for wildflowers, and that is enhanced now with conservation grazing.

It is hoped that this seed bank will spread to the neighbouring (much bigger) grassland over the next few years which will mean it will not have to be seeded.
