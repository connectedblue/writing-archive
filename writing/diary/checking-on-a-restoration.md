Back in March, the [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) team worked on the [restoration of the Millennium Bank](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/03/working-on-the-millennium-bank/). Because it's close to home, I decided to pay a visit and check on progress. I've been on dozens of these work parties over the years, but never really get to see whether what we do makes a difference, or not.

So, it's great to be able to visit a place during the growing season and see what is actually going on.

The last time I saw it, the grass was cut short, scrub and clippings were removed. Now the slope was covered in long grass, buttercups and cow parsley.

I took a closer look and started to hunt for species. The calcareous indicator species I spotted were: bird's-foot trefoil, field scabious, greater knapweed, lady's bedstraw, ox-eye daisy, wild marjoram. Other species were: meadow cranesbill, common vetch, red clover, cutleaf geranium, ribwort plantain, lesser knapweed, yarrow, common vetch.

In general, there was a lot of herbaceous abundance within the long grass. As a comparison, I then walked through the bank on the other side of the scrub which we didn't restore. There I spotted meadow cranesbill, common vetch, red clover, ribwort plantain, and an awful lot of willowherb.

So, it appears that the restoration work has paid off, particularly with the indicator species (there was a pleasing amount of birds foot trefoil, ladys bedstraw, field scabious and knapweed).

This should look visually stunning in the month of June, so I'll be back to take a look!
