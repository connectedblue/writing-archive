Popped down to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) in the morning who are hosting a couple of artists in the [Severn Vale Art Trail](https://www.severnvalearttrail.org/) over the weekend.

The artists [Amanda Griffiths](https://www.severnvalearttrail.org/artists-2023-test-2-1/amanda-griffiths) and [Yana Petrovska](https://www.severnvalearttrail.org/artists-2023-test-2-1/yana-petrovska) had put a magnificent display of their art on show for people to drop in and view. There was a steady flow of visitors who had not visited the site before, so a great opportunity to tell them about the project.

Refreshment for visitors

A number of Wild Acres bakers supplied cake which was available to visitors in the outdoor kitchen.

I helped Vicky for a while, but felt bad on slipping away to watch the snooker - the May bank holiday is always the final of the world championship.

Behind the outdoor kitchen is a fabulous woodland which has an incredible carpet of bluebells at this time of year. It's difficult to do justice on a phone camera, but it stretches as far as the eye can see.

There won't be much outdoor action from me over the next two days. The snooker takes priority on my schedule.
