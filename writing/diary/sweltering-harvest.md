Last minute change of plan for today's harvest with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). Instead of the scheduled field near Bath, I headed over to Woodmancote to a spectacular meadow.

It's a site I know well as we've done several winter habitat management tasks before, and a few years ago I also planted a hedge there.

There were three of us, so Tom started harvesting straight away while Ren and I set up.

He came back pretty quickly, in what would set the pattern for the day. The hopper was filling very quickly, so much so that we didn't have time to sieve it all before he was back again.

I can't remember seeing so much seed off a single harvester for a long time. It was also a very hot and windless day, so pretty hard work all round. There was a small patch of shade under a sycamore we could grab during breaks.

We managed to catch a lot of good species - as well as yellow rattle, there was tons of kidney vetch and rough hawksbeard. I wouldn't be at all surprised if today's haul comes in at 60kg.
