Checked on the three rafts along the Cam for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). There hasn't been any mink spotted for a very long time which is good news, but there is also a lack of any other species recently.

Today was no different, no field signs on any of the rafts. It may well be that the clay cartridge needs replenishing, so I'll meet with Pete at some point to do that.

In the afternoon, I held the first [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of the Autumn term. The regulars returned and carried on where they left off with projects. I've been particularly impressed with a couple of boys who have been digging into the Javascript code for a game and figured out how to change levels and other aspects of the gameplay.

I forgot to take my glasses to the library, which was a real struggle. I borrowed a giant magnifying glass from the library which wasn't terribly good but better than without. Luckily the children were very patient with me while I scanned their code looking for errors.
