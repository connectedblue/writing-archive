It was an early start today. An appointment at the barbers at 7.15am - the only appointment I could get this week when I booked eight weeks ago. It was also the day for the regular raft check for [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer), so I decided to go straight after.

It was only just getting light when I got to the first site. Unfortunately the raft had overturned in the last couple of weeks, and the river was too high to go in and fix. That will have to be repaired with a new cartridge when the water levels are lower.

More success on the other two, with signs of otter present on one. It's all a bit dormant this time of year so good to detect even small signs.

Tomorrow is the Christmas meal at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) and we are all taking parts of it. I decided to make a vegan fig pudding so I spent the remainder of the morning on this.

I've not done a steamed pudding before. It's really very simple and just time consuming with the steaming for three hours without letting it boil dry.
