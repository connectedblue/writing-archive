It's been a very frustrating start to the seed harvesting season with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). The weather has really not been on our side. That was the case again today at [Dyrham Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/bath-bristol/dyrham-park) - a National Trust property with an enormous species rich grassland.

We normally meet at 9.30am, but due to the weather we didn't gather until midday.

However, it was still ropey weather, so after lunch we went on a botanical survey with Anna and Lorna.

This was a great opportunity to test out my survey app again. I have enough information after today to complete it and hand over to them to use in the other sites.

In the end we counted 46 species of wildflowers and grasses on the site. I was able to upload a spreadsheet to the team later in the day, complete with Latin translations, so the app really does save a lot of admin time afterwards.
