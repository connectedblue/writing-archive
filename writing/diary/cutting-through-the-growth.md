Although only a couple of weeks since the last cut, it seemed that [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) was overgrown again in places. But first I checked the wildflower patch which continues to progress very nicely. The yellow rattle and birds foot trefoil was beginning to flower.

Then down to check on the hedge. It's getting very overgrown by the surrounding grass which is obviously competing for both water and light. I think it may need some hand strimming and mulching. But it's a big job - 250 meters of 3 deep hedgerow.

And so, on to the brush cutter. I didn't want to cut too much. Just really those areas where people need to access the beds.

And a couple of bins with potatoes in were very heavily surrounded by nettles.

Another delicious lunch cooked by Cherie. The roasted carrots with the honey glaze were a particular favourite.

We had cut buttercups on the table. Not something we'd normally do, but this bunch were saved from the brush cutter.

In the afternoon, another session of Code Club in [Dursley Library](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/libraries/library-locations-and-opening-hours/dursley-library/). Another new boy started today so we had all 8 computers in action. They are progressing really well - each week they are pushing themselves a bit further to write more interesting and complex code.
