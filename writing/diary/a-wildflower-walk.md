We are lucky to work on many beautiful meadow restorations across the Cotswolds with [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/). Most of the work though takes place from September to March, so we don't get to see the result of our work very often.

So today we met at a site we've been to many times over the last three years. It was a leisurely wildflower walk, led by Anna, stopping for tea, cake and picnic lunch along the way.

We've done various types of habitat management here - seed spreading, scrub bashing, canopy removal and brush cutting. We've also harvested seed from a beautiful meadow at the top.

Two prime objectives have been to create a suitable Duke of Burgundy habitat, and also to encourage the spread of fly orchids.

We took the long route around the site, across parts I'd not been on before. It's a very diverse mosaic habitat and wildflowers were teeming from every corner.

In particular there were many fine examples of butterfly orchid everywhere.

We approached a small section of woodland from behind the main track and soon came across dozens and dozens of fly orchids.

These are incredibly rare plants in the Cotswolds, so we took great care to make sure our group didn't trample any.

It was really inspiring to see them, especially in the areas where we had undertaken some tree thinning a few years ago.

They are much smaller and delicate than I was expecting. But it's very clear to see where they get their name.

We finished with lunch at the top of the track where we normally break during work parties. The weather was overall pretty good, but at times the temperature dropped suddenly and drizzle fell.
