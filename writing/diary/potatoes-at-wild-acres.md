Up early today to do the river monitoring before Wild Acres. I usually do this every two weeks on a Monday, but yesterday was so wet it would have been pointless ... any signs would have been washed away.

First time I've really seen the willow leaves out this year so provides a welcome backdrop to the walk.

Main task at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) was to rotivate the land next to the polytunnel and plant this years potato crop.

This area was planted last year but had become overgrown. Not used a rotivator before, but soon got the hang of it and it made quick work. Better than digging by hand.

The main principle for growing potatoes this year is "no dig". A slot was made for each tuber and pushed in, rather than digging a trench which is normal.

Once it was covered in manure, it can be left to do it's thing. Two varieties sown here which will come up as an early crop.

As usual, a delicious lunch was cooked in the outdoor kitchen by Martin using produce from the polytunnel.
