I was expecting heavy rain all morning at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) today, but it turned out unexpectedly warm and dry (for most at least).

A couple of jobs today. The first was to shovel the remaining gravel at the top of the site into a spot behind the kitchen.

Luckily we have the tractor now which takes a lot of the strain out of work like this. We made a makeshift container, loaded the material onto the back, drove it down the site and then wheel barrowed it behind the kitchen.

The bigger task which will take a few weeks is to remove the very tangled hedge at the top of the site to allow a new hedge to be planted in February.

It consists of dead elm, hawthorn that could be laid, standing mature field maples and lots of bramble.

It's a combination of hand tools and the chain saw to carefully remove the 2 metre thick hedgerow back to the fence line.

The lunch was cooked by Cherie and was a delicious dhal, rice and onion bahjis. The bahji was cooked perfectly and very more-ish. Just as we got under the dining room shelter at 1pm the heavens absolutely open and battered down for about 20 minutes. Really heavy rain.

In the afternoon, I had the last [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of 2023. I was given some cards and small gifts by some of the children which is touching. Most of those who attend now have been coming for several months and are so creative and enthusiastic about coding, it really is a pleasure to witness.

I submitted some dates to the library staff to create the 2024 winter schedule.
