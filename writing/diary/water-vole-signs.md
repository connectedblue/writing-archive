My first trip back to the rafts after [resetting the cartridges](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/07/radio-awards/) a couple of weeks ago. This is an ongoing mammal monitoring project for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer).

The first couple of rafts did not show anything significant.

But the last raft where I first detected possible water vole sightings [back in March](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/03/displacing-the-voles/) was showing very clear signs.

I'm not sure how many animals produce this much latrine over a two week period (this raft was scraped clean last time). But I'm guessing more than one.

Rather oddly, I didn't detect any footprints in the cartridge.

It may be that the clay replenishment hasn't worked. Or, perhaps the terrible weather in the last fortnight has just washed prints away from the surface. Will be interesting to see what's there next time.
