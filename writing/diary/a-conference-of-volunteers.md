It was the annual volunteer conference for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer), so I headed over to the village hall at Whitminster. It's always good to catch up with people in an environment away from the usual habitat management work parties.

The talks were excellent. We had an update of the 2030 strategy from the CEO, an overview of the Treescape project which is planting 60 miles of tree canopy and the community gardens project which is bringing nature into towns.

We also had a presentation from Abby from [Wild Trainees](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/wild-trainees), who outlined the enormous difference the programme has made to new graduates getting jobs in this sector.

I also [gave a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bH4qBPhP-91Z9HdYVC0dHdI2BchTSMvKCTY-mhn0lPQ/edit?usp=drive_link) about the many opportunities and benefits I have experienced as a conservation volunteer over the last couple fo years.

After a delicious lunch, we headed over to Pockett's orchard where Pete gave an excellent talk on the project to create a brand new semi wetland reserve. This is a project I know well, and it's good to have a wider audience see the work involved.
