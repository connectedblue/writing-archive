It was a windy day at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) today, but also the last chance to get the gazebo shelter in place before the development day next week. The frame has been up a while, but we had a new covering to put over.

We decided to put it parallel to the existing dining room to provide extra cover for a large crowd. I think it will also stop that grass area getting quite so waterlogged in future.

It took a bit longer than I expected. It was a bit more fiddly to attach the internal fastenings and then we used additional strapping to secure it to the ground and shelter.

Hopefully it won't blow away in the coming storms this week.

I then got the brush cutter out and tidied some verge areas, in particular around the woodworking area under the existing gazebo next to the art studio. As usual, when diving into undergrowth around the site, I pulled out an assortment of metal and other rubbish to dispose of.

I stayed a bit longer than usual today after another delicious lunch from Cherie. I didn't have code club so spent another 45 minutes clearing rubbish and tools from different parts of the site ready for next Monday.

In the evening there was a meeting of the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk) admin team. Some nice leads came in from a new group who wants a survey done, and we also reviewed the recent successful AGM.
