My friend Kathy texted me about a project she is working with the local secondary school on. They have an amazing piece of land at the end of the school which is essentially unused and covered in scrub. A board walk was constructed there at some point in the past, but it's too damaged and dangerous in it's current condition.

There is a new scheme where schools manage their grounds like a nature reserve and the activities are built into the curriculum delivery. This land is ideal to be managed in this way, but some volunteer time is needed to get it into some shape first.

The priority today was to cut back bramble which is encroaching onto an ever shrinking grassland area.

There were four of us in the drizzle, but we managed to cut back significant areas.

This included the board walk itself which was very covered by the surrounding scrub.

There's a meaty patch of bramble still to clear, but it will be easier with a brush cutter. I will borrow one in the next couple of weeks and come down one afternoon to clear the remainder. As long as it's done before the end of March, we should avoid the nesting season.
