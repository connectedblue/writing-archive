My ideal calendar strategy is that each day should have either zero or one thing scheduled. The last few were unusual because of evening events.

But today my one thing was to meet a friend for lunch at the [Ragged Cot](https://theraggedcot-minchinhampton.com/) in Minchinhampton. We went to school together in Surrey, but somehow managed to end up in neighbouring villages in Gloucestershire.

Nice venue and food, although it's tough to see so few customers mid week. So hard to run a restaurant business at the moment.
