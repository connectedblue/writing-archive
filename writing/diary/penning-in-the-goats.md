We have two goats joining us soon at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), who will help to graze the scrubby bottom part of the meadow. A lot of preparation is needed first though, and I've been helping with the electric fencing.

I borrowed some high quality fencing from [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/), and today started to mark out the area where it will be installed. It's important not to get grass grow under it, as that can cause a short during rain. So I started to cut a 2m wide perimeter strip in the area. That proved much longer than I thought. The vegetation is quite high and managed to do about three quarters of it with the brush cutter.

Chris and Jane joined me from the Glorious Grasslands team, and we all worked on the perimeter cutting and also continuing to clear the woodland path.

Martin and Cherie cooked an absolutely more-ish lunch today. Several individual dishes which combined in a very tasty way.

In the afternoon, I headed over to the library for the second [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of the week. We're down to five now for this day, largely because some have moved from Tuesday to Monday. So I'll take the half term opportunity next week to advertise in the wider community to see if three more places can be filled.
