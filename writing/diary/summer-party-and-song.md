It was the annual summer party at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) where friends of the project gathered for pizza, food and music.

We have a unique pizza oven in the outdoor kitchen ... half a bath covered in clay with a sealed front door. Gets super hot and cooks delicious crispy pizza in no time.

The pizza was accompanied by salad and vegetables, with drinks and crisps. Some people had also brought home made cake so it was quite the feast.

It's always good to catch up with those who don't go regularly to wild acres. There were also several musicians who provided the entertainment and there was quite the sing-a-long by the end.
