The tree planting season continues and [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/) had a huge hedge to plant in the Painswick valley. The aim was to plant 5,000 trees over a two week period, and this event was open to the community to participate.

The farmer had already prepared the land by digging out a strip to plant in. This made it considerably easier than digging into grassy pasture.

What was new for me was the use of biodegradable tree guards. They are clearly more desirable than the plastic spirals (and more expensive too). But time will tell if they survive the weather conditions over the winter.
