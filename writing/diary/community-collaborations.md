Today turned out to be a day of collaborating with different parts of the local community.

In the morning, I sat with Rene and went through how he can build a website in wordpress to sell a local wildlife calendar. There's a lot of functionality that he needs right out the box with woocommerce, so hopefully it won't take him too long to get a basic site live.

In the afternoon, I visited Dave at [Ashen Plains Campsite](https://ashenplains.co.uk/) and discussed the details of an event which they are supporting for this year's walking festival. I had a tour of his whole site and there's some really interesting capabilities which he has built out for outdoor events.

In the evening was the scheduled [Dursley Green Drinks](https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/). This was the best attended yet - over 25 people and several huddles of conversation taking place on the lawn of [Kingshill House](https://www.kingshillhouse.org.uk/).

The whole idea of Dursley Green Drinks was to just connect people in a relaxed environment. It seems to be working, and growing, so we'll book in dates for the next three months.
