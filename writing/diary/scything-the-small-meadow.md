Today was a much anticipated work party with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). Quite a few of us had [recently completed scythe training](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/07/scything-in-the-orchard/) with Nicole from [Joy of Scything](https://joyofscything.uk/) and we were keen to try our skills.

The small meadow at the end of the Fromebridge reserve [was surveyed back in June](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/06/a-corky-fruited-day/) and a really species rich count was observed. The highlight was the abundance of Corky fruited water dropwort, which is a relatively rare floodplain indicator species.

The cattle hadn't been in so everything was in flower and has now turned over. This is a good opportunity to take green hay and spread it in the adjacent field, allowing seed to drop there and spread the nice species into that field.

Onto the scything, and we all got familiar with the kit again. I have bought my own Austrian scythe with a grass and ditch blade, so this was the first outing.

We lined up in a row and went forward more or less as one group to make sure nothing was missed.

It took a few goes to get the technique right again from the training, but after a while there was the satisfying sound of swooshing blade and cut grass. We ended up getting into a bit of a pickle when the grass changed direction and we doubled back on the wrong side and broke the right to left sweep of cut grass.

But all in all, we were pretty pleased by the end of the afternoon. We had cut about 60% of the meadow, spread some hay in the other field and made a habitat pile. There were five of us who were alumni from Nicole's training and we were happy we now had the technique. When we return to do the rest, I'll bring the ditch blade and cut the young blackthorn shoots that are encroaching at the top end.

Later in the afternoon, I went over to the south end of my village to see some work that had been done that morning on restoring a small wildflower bank. It looks in good shape now, so I'll get some seed to sow on a small strip of it in September and we can see how it does next year.
