It was a bit colder than recently at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) today, but still mild for the time of year. My task today was to lay a wood chip path down to the outdoor kitchen where the field gets particularly muddy at this time of year.

The chip was sourced from a nearby clearance of ash trees by the council. A big pile was delivered for free, and I expect that there could be more if required.

Martin hooked up the trailer on the tractor rather than use a wheelbarrow which would have taken a long time.

The material was quite easy to handle, and I spent most of the time shovelling by hand on and off the trailer. We could afford to be quite generous and lay it down thick, although I expect it will be walked into the ground after a couple of weeks.

A particularly delicious lunch

Cherie prepared another exceptional lunch. We used the pumpkins, chillies and herbs from the polytunnel and ended up with a delicious combination of flavours.

New matting was laid down in the kitchen which made a big difference to the non slip surface. The refit has been pretty much completed and it's much easy to work in now.

In the afternoon I held the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. I've been assisted by Gerry for the last couple of weeks which really helps giving extra attention to the children's projects. We tend to get the same group coming each week, so they are all doing much more advanced project work now and progressing amazingly well.
