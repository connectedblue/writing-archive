My second walk for [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) is quite substantial. It's only around 10km in length but the total ascent is 400m. I went out this morning to pre walk the route and check everything's OK.

I know the paths very well, but I never walked this combination before. There was also a small section which was completely new to me.

Rather annoyingly that part had a locked gate and the stile was difficult to climb over. That is going to be a challenge for a group of 20.

Generally the route is pretty good though, and I noted a couple of items for the risk assessment. I bumped into a couple from Waterley Bottom who I had met at [Dursley Green Drinks](https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/) last month so it was good to make that connection again.

I completed the walk in 2h30, but I was going quite fast. I'm allowing 3h 30m for the walk on the day.
