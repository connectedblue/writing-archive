I've not been to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) for a couple of weeks, and, as ever, you can see a noticeable difference in work that has gone on there over the period. The main work in progress is the kitchen revamp. Martin left a list of tasks to continue it, but no-one really felt confident to proceed without his supervision.

I tackled the area of meadow just below the kitchen with a brush cutter. We are due to obtain some floodplain wildflower plants from the Wetlands Trust soon, so we'll need an area to put them in. I cut it very short, with lots of bare earth patches and raked off.

Cherie was cooking lunch today and made an enormous, delicious curry in the wok. There was also some red cabbage ready for picking which made a vibrant, crunchy accompaniment.

Both cooking and clearing up were made more challenging by the kitchen being in a half completed state, but everything will look much better when the renovation is complete.

In the afternoon was the regular scratch club for the 8-11 year olds. No new children today, so everyone carried on with their projects. I set out some coding books today on the table and two were borrowed by children. So that will be a feature of future code clubs so they can explore more at home.
