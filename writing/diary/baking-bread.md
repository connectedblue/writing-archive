Since the pandemic I've been baking bread on a fortnightly cadence. I use the same recipe and technique but the results differ mostly based on ambient room temperature. This impacts how quickly and how well the bread rises during proving.

Today I was pretty pleased with the outcome. Should be somewhat easier as the summer months roll in.
