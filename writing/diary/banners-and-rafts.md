Some housekeeping activities today. First of all, the regular check of the three river rafts for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). There were really no signs at any of the locations, except for a single otter speint on the third one. What was unusual also that the clay cartridges which capture footprints were completely smooth from when I reset them a fortnight ago. Not even insects or snails seemed to have been present since then.

On the way back, I called by Richard's and we made a round tour of the town to put up the banners for the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/).

Last year we made an investment in a whole new set, which was quite a lot of work to design and get made. But it paid off handsomely this year as they are completely re-usable and it only took a couple of hours to do.

We put up banners on the Market Place, leisure centre and pet shop and then drove around the town border signs to put them there too. It's amazing the effect they had. Bookings had dwindled to practically zero the last few days and within hours of putting banners up, we had another 30.
