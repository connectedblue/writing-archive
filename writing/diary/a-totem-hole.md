More old hedge to remove at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) this week. Having previously removed the scrub from the ditch behind the Really Useful Garden, the task today was to cut down the dead elm, keep the major logs and burn the brash.

Cherie had made brownies which were a delicious 11am snack. And then went on to bake an enormous pie using produce from the polytunnel.

Every meal at Wild Acres is different and amazingly tasty.

The totem pole has been completed and looks fabulous. Elaborate carving and brightly coloured paint.

The rather impressive deep hole had been dug to support it, but it's in the wrong place. I filled it in and it will be dug again further down the meadow
