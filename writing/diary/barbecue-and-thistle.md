Another day at Pockett's Orchard with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). We were due to do some grafting, but unfortunately Tim went down with covid at the last minute.

So we broke into groups and tackled various maintenance tasks around the site.

I chose the creeping thistle which has taken over the middle part since we cleared it of bramble last year.

Creeping thistle is a native plant, if somewhat invasive, but we want to encourage a richer grassland here.

Because it's a perennial and very much in seed, it was a laborious task to pull up by the root. We made reasonable inroads into the clump, but there's still a lot of plants (and seeds). At some point we'll probably brush cut in the autumn but that won't remove the roots.

We finished early to have a barbecue and chit chat. The forecast was looking ropey, but the weather pretty much held until the food was ready when it poured for a while.
