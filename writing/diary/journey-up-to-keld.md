Today was a trip to Keld in North Yorkshire for a week's walking holiday. I took the electric car, which meant a bit of extra planning for recharging on the way up.

The first stop was Stafford Services where the car was charged for a short period during a cup of tea. The only available port in the car park was 22KWh, so this only added about 15% back to the charge, but there was enough to get to Burton-in-Kendal for another top up.

The last leg to Keld was eventful. There's an 11 mile single track road which is normally quite quiet. But today a farmer was moving a huge flock of sheep so it took a while before they could be passed.

Then a hold up with a convoy of classic cars where one had got stuck in the ditch.

But the cottage was in good order and there was time to make dinner then watch the rugby before going to bed.
