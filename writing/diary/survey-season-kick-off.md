Decided again, for the second day in a row, to go for an early morning walk at 6am. I hope this is a habit I keep for a while.

The [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) survey team met at 10am to launch this season's series of survey. Anna gave a short overview of the methodology changes, and I did a run through of the app with everyone. We then went to the first field and Anna did a detailed guide to the indicator species we are looking for.

It was a successful morning from my perspective. Everyone seemed to get to grips with the app, and I picked up valuable feedback from observing how they used it. We agreed some further changes that I'll make to improve the species capture on the quadrat page.

It turned out that there was quite a bit of data loss due to the app crashing. This is obviously very counter-productive, but I think the setup procedure can be changed to prevent that.

In the afternoon, I went to the library for the second [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) for the week. A smaller club today with only five, but they all wrote some pretty good code before the games playing.

Afterwards, I popped to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) to drop off electric fencing that I had borrowed from Anna to house the goat in our meadow. This will be the subject of future diary entries, but for now the Goat WhatsApp group is co-ordinating the remaining tasks.
