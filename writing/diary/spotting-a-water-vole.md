Every fortnight I check on a few river locations for signs of small mammals for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). Helps to track movements and numbers, especially of some endangered species like otters and water voles.

You don't see the animals themselves, but you can detect presence by droppings and footprints. By monitoring specific locations at regular intervals, it's possible to build up a regional picture of wildlife activity.

Today I noted possible sighting of water vole and otter. One of them is interesting because there was a possible sighting in the same location also two weeks ago.

One of the rafts had overturned onto the bank and the cartridge was lost. That will need to be reset for next time.

On the way back to the car, I heard a "plop" from the bank and out the corner of my eye, an animal paddling furiously up the centre of the river, creating a choppy wake like an outboard motor.

This was almost certainly a water vole, even though I didn't glimpse the animal as it happened so quickly. That's the first time I've actually seen one live.

In the evening, a meeting of the [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) steering group took place. There's always a lot to discuss, but the main task will be to start the organisation for this year's [walking festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk) in October.
