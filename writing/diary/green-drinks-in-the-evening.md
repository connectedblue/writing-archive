It was a day of admin really. Met up with Martin and Vicky in the morning to discuss some changes to the [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) website.

In the evening we held the third [Dursley Green Drinks](https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/) at Kingshill House.

It does seem to get better each time it runs. New people come in, others drop away, but conversations are always sparked and connections made.

I met some new faces tonight and it amazes me how much talent there is around this area in matters of conservation.
