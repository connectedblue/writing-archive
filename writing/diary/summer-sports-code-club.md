I don't run the regular [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) during school holidays, but I decided to hold three one off events in the library to support the library summer challenge.

The theme this year is sport, so I held a 1.5 hour class on building a two page sport website from scratch. The children ranged from age 9 to 13 and had never done web coding before. All eight PC workstations were filled.

I was very pleased with the outcome. They all had a favourite sport, wrote some text on it, included some youtube videos and images and changed some colours on the page.

It was all in raw HTML and CSS, so a lot of typing involved. But that didn't put them off at all, and I think they were very happy to have a real, live website that anyone with the link can view and they can change how they please.

I also stressed the importance of copyright and not using images from other websites without permission. So we used Getty Images which include a special code which gives permission to display their images on your website. The websites themselves were hosted on neocities.
