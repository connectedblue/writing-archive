The growing season is in full swing at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), and this includes the wild vegetation as well as the horticulture side. Today I looked at managing the parts of the site where access is needed to work and for visitors.

I started out by trimming some docks that were in flower on the top wildflower patch. It's not that overrun here, so I wanted to get rid of seed heads before they drop.

I then changed the head of the brush cutter back to the tri blade and started at the top car park.

It wasn't all that long ago I trimmed this part of the site, but it's worth keeping on top of. I made my way down the rest of the site to the wood working area which was dominated by nettles again. Given that this area is covered, I don't know why it gets swamped so much. I pulled everything out and trimmed as close to the ground as possible.

A hearty lunch from Cherie, washing and drying up, then headed back to Dursley for the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). The Tuesday club had been dwindling somewhat, so last week I put a post on Facebook, and all places are booked again. Three new children and two who haven't been for a while. So the place was buzzing for the hour while everyone did their projects.
