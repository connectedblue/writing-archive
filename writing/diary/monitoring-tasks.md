Bank holiday today, and a couple of tasks to catch up on. I headed out in the morning, just before the rain, to do the regular raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer).

Not much to report today - some otter speint on one of the rafts, but that was about it. The buttercups are out in full force, and the paths along the brook are starting to get a lot of vegetation.

In the afternoon, I met with Toby to survey the car park for ideas for the town's environment land management plan. There's not much inspiration to take - large parts of it are heavily shaded by the surrounding buildings, but there are some areas which would take native hedging.
