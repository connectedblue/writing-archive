Today was the public launch of the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) programme. We marked it by holding a free public walk around the hamlets of Dursley. Around 20 people turned out which was great to see. Some came from Stroud and Stow so we are attracting a wider audience to walking in this area.

It was a very pleasant 7 mile circular led by Richard. It wasn't a route I had done most of before so there's always new paths to learn, even in a familiar area.

The last part of the walk went up Stinchcombe - the long slog up from opposite the rugby club.

A lot of people attending had already booked festival places because they are newsletter subscribers and received the early notification last sunday.

As of this morning, 300 places have been booked (out of 584). So we made excellent progress in the preview week. In the afternoon, I prepared the posts into various facebook groups to start spreading the word. By the evening, bookings started to flow in again.
