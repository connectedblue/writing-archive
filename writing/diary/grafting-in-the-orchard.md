One of the success stories of the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) has been to restore an ancient orchard in Whitminster. Known as Pocketts Orchard, it has been purchased for management as part of a brand new nature reserve.

We are very fortunate to have the expertise of Tim Andrews from the [Gloucestershire Orchard Trust](https://glosorchards.org/) to advise on the management.

This time of year is perfect for grafting tree buds onto rootstock using a method called whip and tongue.

All fruit trees are grafted in order to obtain the exact variety of fruit that gives the desired taste. The pear trees in this orchard are 250 years old and you can clearly see the evidence of grafting all those years ago in the now thick trunks.

I grafted a few and took one home to watch it grow. Hope to be able to see buds growing in the next few weeks which will confirm if the graft is successful.
