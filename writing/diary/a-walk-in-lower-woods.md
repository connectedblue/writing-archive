My first time visiting [Lower Woods](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/nature-reserves/lower-woods) today. There was supposed to be an organised walk by Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust for volunteers, but with crossed wires I didn't get the email cancelling it. There were three others also who turned up.

So we organised our own impromptu tour of the woods. It really is stunningly beautiful, and a rich, dense habitat. But the paths were very difficult to negotiate, especially after the heavy rain. This is on the list to return to again in the summer months.

In the evening, I met with Toby and we took a tour of the rec to firm up plans for the environmental land management plan at the town council. There are plenty of improvements which can be made which will increase biodiversity, but still retain the main amenity use for the space.
