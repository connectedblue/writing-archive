I met up with Graham at 10am and we went to the site we have adopted for regular riverfly monitoring. It's located in a beautiful spot, just off a public footpath and a shallow, but varied habitat for sampling.

I did the three minute kick sample and one minute rock sample while Graham timed. Time goes very slowly when you're doing this part.

I had to stop several times during the rock sample because the water was ice cold when putting my hand in to collect rocks.

There were two stand out species right from the off. A huge number of cased caddis, which are always a favourite. And an abundance of olives. No mayfly, which also tallies with [a sample I took on Monday](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/06/signs-of-river-life/) further up the Frome catchment. There was also a solitary blue-winged olive.

Not a great deal of gammarus. This is somewhat surprising and something we'll keep a close eye on.

Collecting the fly from the tray to the sorting dish was made much easier by using a brush. They seemed to step on it which made moving very quick. So Graham pulled out the different species and I put into the correct segment on the dish.

Overall, the score from the site was 7 - an improvement from last month's 6 but consistent with other places on the Frome. So overall, a pretty healthy river.
