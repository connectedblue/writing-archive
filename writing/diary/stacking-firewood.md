After the abandoned wassail a few weeks ago at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), the fire pit was a messy collection of cut and charred wood. We have a development day in a few weeks, so this whole area needs to get smartened up. I spent my time sorting out this section and stacking the wood neatly for when the next fire is to be built.

I sorted the wood into three broad piles - short, sawn logs in the covered wood store; bigger chunks on the ground next to them; and finally treated and processed scrap wood.

There was also a nice pile of brash which would make good kindling. That needs a home somewhere.

And finally a pile of longer wood that needs sawing before storing. Underneath everything was a pile of coal. I have no idea where that came from, but I found a bucket to store it away.

In the afternoon, I held the final scratch [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) for this term. We had some nice final projects around the theme of easter which enabled the children to express their creativity.

In the evening was the admin meeting for [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk). It was the final touches for the AGM this weekend, which sadly I will miss as I'm on holiday. But a lot of work has gone into the event and the 2024 programme, and it should be a great kick off meeting with members.
