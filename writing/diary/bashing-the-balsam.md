My first Himalayan Balsam removal for 2024 with the [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/). We met down at Ebley Mill, a site which we spent quite a bit of time last year doing the same thing.

The first thing we noticed was the big increase in Giant Hogweed. This is a very dangerous plant, so we kept well away.

We took photos and location notes and Ruth will organise someone to come and destroy it. Worryingly, there was a huge example out in the open meadow, next to a public footpath.

The Balsam was clear in some places that we did last year, which was pleasing. But other areas seemed as bad as ever.

We made good progress on both sides of the meadow as the morning wore on. We stopped for some excellent cake from Mike and found a pleasant spot for lunch.

Soon after, the weather turned, so after about an hour we called it a day. We'll be returning next week to continue.

After making a couple of loaves of bread in the afternoon, I headed into town at 6.30pm for a meeting of the Environmental Land Management planning group. We're making good progress on the management plans for the council owned land, but need to push them over the line. I took on Long Street car park and will write the plan for the next meeting.
