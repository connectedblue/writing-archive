A break day today after the last three days of strenuous walking. I needed to top up on supplies so it was a good chance to drive across the moors to Hawes, shop and look around.

It's quite a remote drive from Keld over the butter tub pass - mostly single track road with steep drops on one side.

Hawes is a honey pot for the area so there was ample parking at the visitor centre and even for a wednesday the town was packed.

It's got the usual array of shops you would expect for a tourist town, but there was also a small supermarket which was well stocked.

A chance also to go the the Wensleydale Creamery - home of Wensleydale cheese. They had a comprehensive tasting room where you can have the best part of a lunch on the samples alone. I bought two slices - the blue and the ginger which should last for ten days or so.
