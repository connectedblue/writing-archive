Just behind Llangynidr is a vast, wild moor with a spectacular cave right in the middle. This was a secret location for members of the Chartist movement to stockpile weapons prior to the Newport Rising in 1839 which was one of the last insurrections to be tried in the UK. A circular walk from the cottage was about 18km and 600m elevation, so a fine choice of walk for today.

The first part of the hike was relatively easy. A slog of an upward trail along moss laden paths until reaching the open moor at the top.

I've been to the cave before, but from the other direction and it was foggy. It can be quite difficult to find, but from this direction the path was well defined.

I stopped there for lunch and it makes you wonder how they carried heavy gear up in poor clothing and after long shifts in the coal mines. After lunch, I set off in a broadly horseshoe direction to pick up the ridge back to the village.

However, it became pretty clear that there was no marked path and it was very easy to drift in the wrong direction. For most of the next two hours, I just followed the GPS marker on the phone and managed to get to the correct corner of the moor top exit.

It was tough going underfoot. Although the weather was reasonable, there was a lot of water and mud from the previous weeks. This, combined with the direction finding difficulties, made it an energy sapping part of the walk.

Once back in the farm territory, everything became much easier. The village was visible in the distance and the paths well marked. All in all, this is a great circular walk, with important history thrown in.
