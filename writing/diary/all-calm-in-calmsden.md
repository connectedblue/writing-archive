Today we were back to the site which has the dubious honour of being the last one for [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) before the first covid lock down in 2020.

The task today was simple - remove the hawthorn saplings that have sprouted on a beautiful south facing wildflower bank.

The key tool here was the tree popper which allows a tree to be pulled out with the root intact.

The nice thing about visiting a site again is that you can see the progress made since last time. It's been a while since we visited this, and the scrub was beginning to take hold again. But even at this time of year you can see the abundance of wildflowers that have taken root.
