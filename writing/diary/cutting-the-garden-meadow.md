It was finally time to cut back the wildflowers in the back garden. Pretty much all the seed has dropped by now, and there was a break in the weather.

I used the strimmer first to take away the long material, and then the lawnmower to get a really low cut. This produced bare earth patches in most places. I sprinkled some extra seed - mostly meadow grasses, kidney vetch and field scabious. The rest of the species should grow back next year.

This simulates a hay cut, although I'll be taking the clippings to the local tip. Next March or early April, I'll cut again to simulate grazing. And then look forward to another wildflower display next summer.
