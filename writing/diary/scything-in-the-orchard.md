Went over to Longney orchard for some scything training for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). This is a beautiful 16 acre heritage orchard hidden away in a corner of the Severn Vale. The facilities were excellent for a remote place - an old brick barn for shelter, a compost loo and mains water.

The training was given by Nicole from [Joy of Scything](https://joyofscything.uk/), who right from the start oozed passion and knowledge for the craft. The course was split around understanding the roles that the self, the scythe and the vegetation all play in contributing to a successful mow.

The first part was quite a bit of time on understanding the Austrian scythe itself and all the different blades.

What's particularly important are the various angles built into the design which contribute to different cutting techniques for various situations.

We also went through how to set up the scythe exactly for your body and safely assemble it for use.

Just before lunch, we then spent a bit of time on body movement. Most of the work comes from transferring your weight from foot to foot using the knees and keeping the back straight. Building muscle memory for moving the right way means you can spend a whole day scything without putting your body through too much stress.

After lunch, we then tackled the vegetation. A lot of this is about planning the area to cut in advance and moving the blade in a direction where the grass is bending toward the blade, helping with a clean cut.

When moving in strips, the technique is cut from right to left and pile the cut material to the left. The first strip will be hardest because you have uncut material to your left providing resistance. But then, you walk back to the start, step to you right and cut the next strip. In this case, you already have a cut strip on you left and the id no resistance for the newly mown material.

Another key point, especially in community scything sessions, is that you remove what you cut. There are not dedicated cutters followed by exhausted rakers behind.

I've done a course on this before, but the whole technique hadn't really sunk in and I use the brush cutter a lot. However, I'm totally sold on this now as the way forward so will be investing in my own scythe and blades for the future.

Nicole is a fantastic teacher and if you are interested in learning this skill, I highly recommend booking onto [one of her courses](https://joyofscything.uk/courses2/).
