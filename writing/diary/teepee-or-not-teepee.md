Martin acquired a teepee for the meadow, so I had an unexpected introduction to the art of erecting them. I arrived a bit late and had planned to do some brush cutting, but soon got seconded onto the teepee team.

There were no instructions, and armed with a partially watched youtube video, we set about assembling the sticks into a cone shaped circle which was broadly the right circumference for the canvas. These were then secured with rope and made a reasonably solid and stable structure.

The major problem arose when trying to lift the heavy canvas to the top of the structure using a lifting pole. Unfortunately, half way up the pole snapped under the weight, so we tried a different technique. This kinda worked, but the canvas wasn't really sitting securely at the top. At this point we realised it was also inside out.

So we decided to disassemble the whole structure and retry next week, perhaps after watching more videos. By this point, it was 1pm and Cherie had prepared an insanely delicious lasagne, followed by rhubarb crumble from Solveig.

In the afternoon, it was the second [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of the week in the library. Thankfully today there were no IT problems. We did get a call though from the central IT department to check. So it's good to see that they are on the case with providing a decent service for us.
