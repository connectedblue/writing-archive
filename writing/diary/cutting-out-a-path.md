The brook at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) has a path running along it's length that had got very overgrown during the summer. I took the brush cutter and cut back all the ground vegetation for about three quarters of it, opening access to the small peninsula.

I could then cut a few large hazel branches which were over hanging the path from above. The only thing that remains is to make the steps cut into a slope a bit more robust and safer.

We were treated again to a fabulous lunch, cooked by our Sri Lankan friend. The polytunnel is yielding a lot of fresh ingredients at the moment, and you can't beat freshly cooked food.

In the afternoon, it was the regular [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). The children have mostly gone back to school this week, so it's more of a routine now. Two new children attended the club today.

In the evening I joined the admin meeting of the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk) by zoom. I haven't joined this for a while for one reason and another, so it was good to catch up. I took some actions away to progress over the next week or so.
