It's been quite a few weeks since I had visited [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) on a Tuesday. Over the summer there were other projects I needed to complete and Tuesday was the only day that could be freed up easily to get them done.

I took my scythe in anticipation of quite a bit of mowing that needed to be done. Normally I'd use a brush cutter but really wanted to work on my scything technique. The ditch blade was selected to tackle the top wildflower area which has become a bit overrun with hogweed and blackthorn.

It didn't take too long to complete the patch, and although it would have been quicker with the brush cutter, everyone else appreciated no drone of the motor.

On interesting thing was that I damaged the cutting part of the blade of the thick, woodier stems so it was time for some peening.

I hadn't actually used the peening jig before, so a quick YouTube video showed the basic technique of using the two caps in sequence while tapping with the hammer and drawing the blade through.

I was happy that it generally worked and the blade was more or less back in shape. I think I'll have to get a file so I can fine tune the edge a bit more. There is a vice at wild acres, so that was sufficient to hold the jig in place to work.

It was great to catch up with people again, and have the lunches which I've missed. Cherie baked an enormous lasagne which we had with a fresh tomato salad. At this time of year, all the produce is freshly picked which always elevates the food flavours.
