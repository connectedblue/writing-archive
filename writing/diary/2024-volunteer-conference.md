It was the annual volunteer conference for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer), held this year at the village hall in Bentham. It's always a good opportunity to catch up with people, and also get an update on what the Trust has been doing more broadly beyond the projects I'm involved with.

After an introduction from Ellie, we had a talk from the new CEO about the strategy and focus areas, which was broadly nature recovery, community engagement and getting the right delivery infrastructure in place. That was followed by an excellent talk from Claire, the learning manager, who gave a flavour of the extensive work done with schools to connect young people more closely to nature.

That was followed by a brilliant presentation from the Wild Trainees on some new drone technology that's being trialled to undertake landscape scale survey mapping. Finally Hannah gave an update on the land management activity in the west region.

We then had a delicious buffet lunch and a chance to catch up with more people.

For the afternoon, a walk at Crickley Hill was arranged, guided by Grove who talked about the extensive adder project designed to preserve the habitats for these creatures which are already extinct in other counties.

A lot of work has been done by volunteers at that site, both in terms of habitat management and also surveying to keep track of the various adder populations.

Special thanks go to Ellie, our amazing co-ordinator, who organised the whole event and also works tirelessly through the year to make sure the volunteer experience with GWT is the best it can be.
