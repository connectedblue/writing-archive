Unfortunately there are very few calcareous grasslands left in the Cotswolds, but the very best ones are part of the [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) project. Today was another special site on a farm that has recently converted from arable to stock only.

We met early in already blistering sun and left our road vehicles by the field gate. The site we were aiming for was deep into the farm. It was located on a high plateau and you could see straight away that this was a very species rich meadow.

The stand out species were Autumn gentian, yellow wort, fairy flax, dwarf thistle and kidney vetch.

We also came across Squinancywort which is a very rare plant in this part of the world.

Not everything was in seed, but a good number were, so we knew we were in for a good day.

The kidney vetch in particular was present in huge quantity on every haul. Along with black medick.

Only one harvester today, but it was enough. Three of us were sifting and we couldn't complete the last load before the next arrived. The sun beat down most of the day, and only brief respite when clouds came over and a breeze picked up. The predicted thunderstorms never arrived though.
