I am sat at table height, presumably in a high chair. I can see the table under the window and three people sat around it having tea. Two are my mum and dad, and the other was my maternal nanna.

They are playing with the HP sauce bottle, unscrewing the cap and banging the end but nothing is coming out. They pass it to each other to try.
