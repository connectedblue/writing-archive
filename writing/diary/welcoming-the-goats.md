Finally, after weeks of preparation, the goats have arrived at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). So far, they have stayed inside the electric fencing, but have yet to make a big dent in the scrub. They were a bit shy and kept to themselves at the other end of the paddock.

That meant I could return to work on restoring the woodland path which seems like ages ago when it was started.

The route from the top of the steps had completely overgrown, so I tore through it with the brush cutter and restored a safe pathway.

Stunning lunch

It turns out that the hazel also grew a bit more than expected, despite some heavy winter pruning. I'll have to take care of this next week with a silkie because the overhanging branches get in the way a bit.

What a fabulous lunch Cherie prepared today. I know I say that pretty much every week, but the pakora today was sublime. I ate way too many, they were so more-ish.

In the afternoon, it was the last [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) for the term. I had ten children today, so there was some PC sharing across the 8. It's good to see the enthusiasm still being kept up after a long school year, but I think most will be coming back next term.
