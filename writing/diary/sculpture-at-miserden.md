I had spent the night at my Mums, setting up her new laptop. I made an early start back home, wanting to avoid the worst of the bank holiday traffic leaving the South East today.

In the evening, went over to the [Cotswold Sculptors Exhibition](https://www.cotswoldsculptorsassociation.com/cotswold-sculptors-association/exhibitions/) in Miserden. This was a preview evening, with no charge for entrance. The main exhibition runs from 1 June to end July.

There were over 250 pieces set in the beautiful landscape of [The Garden at Miserden](https://www.miserden.org/garden/).

You couldn't really ask for a better backdrop, weather and art display. Everything came together to create a stunning exhibition.

The pieces are all for sale, ranging from £300 to £4,800. It took a good hour and a half to look at them all.

Was also a chance to see the gardens themselves. Absolutely stunning trees, wildflowers and manicured gardens, spread out over 850 acres.
