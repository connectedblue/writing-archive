I have a busy day tomorrow so I brought forward my regular river raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) during the morning.

The first raft was in very shallow water. The raft was sitting on the silt bed. Given that the levels in this location are controlled by a pumping station, I'm not sure why it had to be so low today. There were signs of otter on this raft.

When I got to the second raft, I found it had banked itself and twisted around the mooring rope. Luckily the cartridge was in tact, so I was able to reset and refloat it for next time.

In the afternoon, I met with David to discuss an idea for a forthcoming tree walk in May. This will be used as an opportunity to launch a new Trees and Meadows group for the village and get people to see what the plans are.

We had a quick scout around the village for a rough route. There are quite a few interesting trees, so we should be able to get a 5km circular which isn't too strenuous.
