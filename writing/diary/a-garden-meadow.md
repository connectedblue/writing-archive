I've been creating a wildflower meadow in my tiny back garden for the last three years. It's chock full of different species ... knapweed, lesser trefoil, self heal, salad burnett, oxeye daisy and more.

But today I spotted yellow rattle. For the first time. Only about 5 or 6 young plants but enough to get going. Once they set seed, there should be more next year. This will hopefully thin the grass out and really let the wildflowers shine.

A long meeting with Richard today on the initial plan for the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). It's held in October but it's good to have an early view of a strategy and approach.
