I headed off early to [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) and was there by 9am to make a start on the remainder of the wildflower plugs for the meadow which we [started on Tuesday](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/05/plugging-the-floodplain/). Another very warm day, so it was good to get an hour done early.

A couple of new people turned up today, so I showed them around at 10am just before the others arrived. We had plenty of spare hands, so it didn't really take all that long to get the remaining plants in the ground. So hopefully we should see a nice display of flowers in a couple of months and then set seed for more to spread next year.

I then brush cut a lot of the verges at the top of the site in preparation for an open day on Saturday.

It's amazing how much metal I'm still finding on site, even though I cut these areas regularly.

After lunch, we continued to tidy the site and move more rubbish up to the top. The site is generally tidy, but with so many people and activity going on, things just accumulate in the wrong places.

In the evening I went to the council offices for a meeting of the environmental land management group. We reviewed the plans for the amenity areas and had some good ideas for exploring more options for increasing biodiversity in the town.
