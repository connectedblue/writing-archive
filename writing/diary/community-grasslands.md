We had a visit from [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) today to assess what can be down with public spaces to support wildflowers. There are some moves to put proposals to the Parish Council and other land owning trusts to change the management regime of certain patches of grassland to encourage more biodiversity and connecting corridors.

There were two promising areas of unimproved calcareous grassland that make good candidates for restoration.

One is a large, south facing bank between an amenity area and a stream. And the other is a small common area by the side of a busy road.

They don't necessarily need over seeding - the first task will be to cut and rake off to reduce nutrient.

There were also some more public areas which would benefit from a native perennial seed mix and late season cut. It's a multi year project to get them established, but once they take hold, they don't need annual seeding.

Once the various permissions are obtained, there will need to be a volunteer group established to carry out the management plan.
