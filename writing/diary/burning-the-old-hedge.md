Arriving at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) this morning, we were greeted with huge piles of cut wood stacked in the top part of the site. The community payback team had been at the weekend and cut a lot of the old hedge back. They will be visiting again this weekend, so we need to burn the arisings to make room for more.

This hedge leads to ancient woodland and historically would have been part of that until it was cleared for agriculture.

The plan is to keep the mature hawthorn and lay them as a hedge. New saplings can then be planted in the gaps to encourage a new hedge.

So the task today was pretty simple - drag the material to one of two fires on the site. It took pretty much the whole morning until lunch, but we managed to clear the piles. We were then treated to a delicious lunch, cooked by Martin on an open fire.

In the afternoon it was the second [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of the new year. These are getting very popular now - the Monday and Tuesday sessions are booked out. Today there were no new people so the children carried on with their projects.

I have moved a few on from scratch to python and that is bedding in well. I put together my own set of python exercises for them to complete - just 6-7 line scripts to make sure the key concepts are grasped.
