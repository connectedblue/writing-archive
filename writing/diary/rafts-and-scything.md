Set out early for the regular raft check for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). Activity seems very quiet now in the river, with very little new to observe.

It has been raining reasonably hard recently, so a lot of evidence might have been washed away. But one of the rafts I hadn't visited for four weeks since there were access issues. For the first time in months on that site I saw no otter evidence.

There were rather curious cows lined up on the other side of the bank for another raft, and I was glad the field gate was shut.

In the afternoon, I continued to scythe the wildflower patches around my house.

Most seed has dropped now, and I managed to hand harvest quite a bit of knapweed which I'll use to seed other areas next year.
