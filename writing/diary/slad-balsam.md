A location in the Slad valley today with [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/), where we continued a project to remove Himalayan Balsam from the top of the catchment for the valley.

A team had visited the site already to make a start and we continued the work. The site was steep sided and careful footing was needed to remove the balsam safely.

There was a small pond which was completely surrounded, but with teams working both sides, we managed to completely clear it.

About half of it was in flower, and most was pretty tall. However, the bad weather overnight had flattened a lot of it so it made pulling a bit tricker as sheaves of stalks lay horizontal.

But soon after lunch we had completed the site so we left a bit earlier.
