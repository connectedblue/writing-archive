Today was the first official tree survey session along the canal for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). Mike and I met at Walk Bridge, which is the demarcation point of the restored canal to the west and the unrestored to the east.

This is the location of the first couple of trees on the records - a scot's pine and sycamore growing very closely together. Both were still in fine shape, so the resurvey got off to a positive start.

We are still having some teething problems with using the app on iphone, so I took the task of recording while Mike checked the condition of each tree.

Unfortunately it was an area of poor coverage, so there were glitches in capturing the data, particularly some of the images.

But we managed to survey about 60 trees. Most were no change from last time, but a couple had some additional concerns which we noted. There were also a couple of records missing from the original set which we updated.

So a good start to the activity this year, but a long way to go!
