My friend Nick and I decided to go to the free open air concert at Brockworth Park in Brixton which was held after a CND rally (part of the 1983 year of peace). There was a whole host of bands playing there including Style Council, Hazel O'Connor, the Damned and Madness (who we really wanted to see).

We took the train up to London, and not being interested in the march itself, arrived very early at the concert venue, which meant we were right down the front, mixed in with all the Damned fans, sporting mohicans and leather jackets. The damned were on first and it was utter carnage. Everyone was pogo dancing and throwing stuff around. Some [footage exists from the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQeWzFThoo), which depicts the chaos as I remember.

Nick and I got split up soon after the concert started . We were only 14 and clearly out of our depth. I stayed until the end and saw all the bands. At one point, John Peel was throwing CND t shirts into the crowd and I managed to grab one, picking it off the neck of a punk in front of me. He grumbled a bit but nothing more. I put it on over my bomber jacket as it was about three sizes too big.

I don't really remember the journey home. As it happens, Nick and I were both on the same train back but didn't meet until the platform at Epsom.

It was my first concert, and one of the first times I'd been to London alone. I honestly thought that was just how the world was, and I'd have to get streetwise enough to live in it. It's only looking back now that I find it more terrifying.
