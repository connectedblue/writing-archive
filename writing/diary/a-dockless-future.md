An unsettled outlook at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) today. Most of the day the weather held off, although at lunch time the heavens opened.

The main task today was supposed to be strimming, but the brush cutter had conked out. Probably needs a service.

So instead I started to cut the seed heads from the docks growing in between the new hedge.

There are a lot of dock in the meadow, but hopefully by preventing the ones near the hedge from laying down seed, it'll provide less competition in future years while the hedge established.

We had a wonderful chef from Sri Lanka visit today and he cooked a very delicious traditional Sri Lankan meal today.

In the afternoon, the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) had it's first session of the summer holidays. Nice to see some familiar faces returning, but we also had two new starters. Looks like a fun summer of coding ahead.
