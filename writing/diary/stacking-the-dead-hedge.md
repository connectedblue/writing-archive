We have a winter long project with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) to create around 300m of new stock proof fence in the species rich grassland. So far the work has been to remove about 100m of old fence and cut the scrub back to a new fence line. Today the arisings from previous work parties needed to moved from the field itself and used to create a dead hedge behind the new fence.

It's been many years (perhaps decades) since the old fence was made. There is a mature tree line which is the boundary but in front there was dense, younger vegetation which had sprouted up.

We wanted to avoid handling material twice, so the previously cut material was placed as far back to the mature tree line as possible.

This creates a nice work space to put in the new fence posts in a straight line, but also reclaims more grassland for the future. On average, we went back 2-3 metres with the scrub, so just in this 100m line we will have gained 300 square metres or so of meadow once it is finished.

There were quite a few of us today, so although there were huge piles of chopped branches when we arrived, by the end of the task it was all clear, and we had an extra straining post added in the middle.

This should mean that next time we will be banging in the intermediate posts, ready for the fence itself.
