Despite an initial downpour first thing, the weather turned very warm by the time we gathered at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) for the day's tasks. We are expecting a mountain of horse manure soon, so the priority was to clear an area by the poly tunnel where we can manage the pile through the winter.

There were quite a few of us, so we concentrated on clearing the area so we could push the table back and make everything a bit more accessible.

I cut the remaining willow behind the greenhouse so we'll get a lot of light through the winter.

The tricky job was pulling up the old carpet that was outside the polytunnel.

Roast potato lunch

It's meant to serve as a protection against slipping in the wet winter months, but it had become knitted with vegetation into the ground. We pulled up the pieces, turned them over the pressed them back into place.

Again, the most amazing lunch from Cherie. The roast potatoes were sublime, and the shared recipe will be tested out by quite a few of us over the coming weeks.

In the afternoon I held another [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. It was a full house of 8 children, each of whom were working diligently on their different projects. It's great to see not only the progress they make each week, but also the amazing creativity they apply to their projects.
