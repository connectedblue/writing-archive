I'll be leading a couple of walks at this year's [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). So it's time to do the pre walk and fill out the risk assessments for them. Today was a very short walk - around 2.5 miles, which takes in all the ancient stone stiles around Cam.

There are eight stiles in all which each have a bit of history that I need to learn. Although short, this walk has some pretty dramatic views as it's mostly on high ground.

This walk is also available as a self guided walk on the [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) website. It's one of the most popular.

When I got back into Cam it was lunch time, so I had a delicious veggie burger and chips at Froffy Coffee.
