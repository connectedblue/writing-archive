Felt like a real autumnal day at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) today, a sharp wind and driving rain at times. Still, that doesn't really stop progress, and today was all about finishing off a new patch for wild flowers and sowing seed.

I had started to brush cut an area last week, but after it was raked, it was clear I needed to do it again to get it really short. We want to sow the seeds on bare earth and give them the best chance against dominant grass next year.

The seed I had was a mix from various places. There should be a lot of native calcareous grassland plants coming up next year.

I also threw down some wooly thistle seed which I had hand harvested separately. This is a huge plant, and quite rare (at least in the higher grounds of the Cotswolds). I think it looks magnificent and hope that it comes up.

Cherie cooked us an incredible lunch - really delicious rice, dhal and vegetables. Feels good to have warm fresh food during weather like this.

In the afternoon I had another session of [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). This continues to be well attended and the children are making excellent progress with their projects. I have agreed a new Monday club with the library aimed at 11-14 year old where we will cover HTML and python. I sent out the booking links to my email list this evening and hopefully that will generate some interest in the community.
