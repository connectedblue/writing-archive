This has been in the calendar for a while. The first [Gloucestershire Data Day](https://dataday.org.uk/) was organised by a few local organisations to discuss how we use data for the benefit of the community.

The day got off to an unusual start. I arrived at the venue and realised I had left my phone at home - something I haven't done for a decade or so. So I had to arm myself with a pen and paper to write down contact details. Sadly it also meant I couldn't get any photos from the day.

It was very successful though and everything I had hoped. The diversity of organisations and data use was enormous but there was a clear desire to collaborate more. Of course, events like these are a good way to expand a network. I met a few people I already knew and made some valuable new contacts.
