During a [climate and community conference](/2023/09/connecting-on-climate/) last week, I heard about a meeting on community energy projects which took place this evening in Stroud. I got a lift up with renewable energy enthusiasts from [Dursley Green Drinks](https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/), so the conversation in the car was a useful backdrop for the event.

There were presentations from three organisations about what is being done so far. The [Gloucestershire Community Energy Co-op](https://gloscommenergy.org.uk/) kicked off with a short history of how they started, and then an overview of how they use community financing to create solar projects. Investors get paid interest and income is generated for the organisation under the roof, as well as lowering their monthly electricity bill.

Next up was the [Big Solar co-op](https://bigsolar.coop/) who are a national non profit energy society who are installing large rooftop solar. They are volunteer driven to find sites and a core professional team drive through that pipeline to build. They were founded in 2022 and the aim is to have 100MW of capacity by 2030. Investors can put in £100 to £100,000 and receive interest of 2% above base, and capital repayments projected in the late 2030s.

The last presentation was from [Transition Stroud](https://transitionstroud.org/) who are working to get PV panels installed on rooftops right across the Stroud district. They also have funding for e-bike hubs and are looking for local delivery partners.

There was then a session where everyone contributed ideas to four questions that were posed on separate tables. This led to an action plan which the organisers will commit to forming.

Afterwards, we went to the Alehouse to continue the conversations. The uplifting part of the whole evening was to participate and feel the energy from local people who want to see and make this happen. There's a huge task ahead, but the community seems well resourced and motivated for the journey.
