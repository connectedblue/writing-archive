This is the time of year to let all plants thrive. The back garden won't be cut now until late August and there are knapweed, oxeye daisy, red clover, hedge bedstraw, field scabious and many more competing with the grass for food and light.

There's not such a thing as a weed really. If you can't identify it, then there are several apps that can help. I use [Picture This](https://www.picturethisai.com/) which is indispensable for trees and flowers. If you let plants grow, you'll be rewarded with armies of pollinating insects.

The lane next to the house is also showing promise. I've been putting wildflower seed down for a few years, but the ground cover has been choking the growth.

Luckily utility workers dug it up to repair a pipe last September so I was able to put down new seed.

There are nettles, hedge bedstraw, oxeye daisies, borage, sow thistle, forget me nots and herb robert. Hopefully they will get to flower and seed before the council think they "look untidy" and strims them to the ground.
