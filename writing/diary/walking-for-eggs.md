The circular walk into town takes in a large, free range poultry farm. It doesn't advertise egg sales to passers by, but if you go into the barn with some egg boxes, you'll be able to buy some.

Freshly laid, they are picked still warm from the conveyor belt which runs continuously in the hen house. At least five of the dozen were large, so will probably be double yolked.

As always, there's time to pop into the [Chantry Centre](https://www.chantrycentre.org/) for tea and cake. It was the second birthday of the cafe today, so there was an extra slice of birthday cake to take home for later.

Bumped into Richard and we reflected on how well the [Green Drinks](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/05/surveying-stancombe/) went the other night. There were some additional connections that could help out some of the projects mentioned during the evening.

Walking back along the Cotswold Way, the sun began to beat down. It's likely to be the hottest weekend so far this year. In the mid-afternoon, time was mostly inside, to stay cool.
