We took delivery of 500 floodplain wildflower plug plants at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) for the meadow restoration and today was the first opportunity to plant them out. It was baking hot, and no rain forecast for a few days, so we need to get them in the ground as soon as possible.

The meadow had been cut recently, so there was plenty of scope to place the plants in strategic locations. The meadowsweet was put in places where there are effectively underground rivers flowing from the fields above. So they will be in a continuous damp area, and will help to suck up any phosphates that might be run off from the neighbouring farm.

The others were mixed and place in polygon areas marked out with spray paint. The other species were bethony, devil's bit scabious, field scabious, lady's bedstraw and sneezewort. I mapped the location in my survey app so we can find them in the summer when we want to cut through the grass.

We got around half the plants in the ground by lunch time. I had to go afterwards, so decided to come back again on Thursday to complete.

We had a delicious lunch cooked by Cherie on probably the first really hot day of the year at Wild Acres.

Birds on site today were: Chiffchaff, goldfinch, robin, woodpecker, wren, blackcap and blackbird.

In the afternoon, I headed over to the library to run the Scratch [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). We pretty much managed to get code written for around 40 minutes before they started playing games, which is the new club rules I introduced at the beginning of term.

Still beset with connectivity issues though, and there's a guy from the central IT department visiting to check it out. Hopefully these will be resolved by next week.
