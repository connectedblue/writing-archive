A substantial hedge has been planted over the winter by [Stroud Valleys Project](https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/) and we returned today to complete the mulching of the full length.

The nearby garden centre had a huge pile of mulch from their christmas tree pulping in January, so we loaded it into the back of the truck and drove it down to the hedge. Luckily the ground was a lot drier than in previous weeks so no issues with needing to dig the truck out.

We were laying it down quite thick, about 10 to 15cm around the base.

We managed a pretty good rhythm of scooping, barrowing and shovelling and we only needed three truckfuls to complete the hedge to the end.

We also had some great help from the Star College students who joined us until lunchtime.
