Up early this morning to meet Tony at Ebley for the monthly riverfly count. There are no worries about levels at all at the moment - the river was barely above the ankles in the place where we monitor.

What was surprising was a sudden drop in species count. We didn't put this down to pollution, since there were numerous gammarus, but maybe it's due to everything having hatched recently. We'll make a note on the website report and see what is made of it. We only observed gammarus and olives.

Straight after, I headed over to the River Cam to check on the rafts. Nothing special to report here, except very clear otter signs which we had seen the past several times on this stretch.

I very quickly made bread when I got home, before heading off to the first [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of the week. A full house, with all PCs taken and quite a few projects completed. It's getting toward the end of term, and I think a few are demob happy.

In the evening, there was an impromptu online Homebrew website club on writing. This was a pretty wide ranging and interesting discussion on the nature of writing blogs.
