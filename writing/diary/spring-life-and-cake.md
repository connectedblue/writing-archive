It's always nice on a Saturday morning to do a familiar route and see the difference a new season makes.

This week cows have been let back into fields. I guess that the ground is now firm enough after the March rain. And the hedgerows are starting to fill out with new leaves.

It's always nice to stop off for tea and cake in the community cafe. A very reasonable Â£6 for cake and tea for two.

The [Gloucestershire Rail Community Partnership](https://www.gloucestershirecommunityrail.org/) were hosting a display with information about a summer bus service connecting the station with the surrounding area.

The service will run at weekends and timed to connect with arriving and departing trains. A great pilot initiative in an area where local buses are getting scarcer.

They also produce marketing leaflets with maps and local information. They have funding to produce more so it could be something that [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) could partner with them to showcase walks from the local station.
