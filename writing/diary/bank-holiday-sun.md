It's been a quiet bank holiday weekend. The weather has been warm and sunny, and I've spent time between admin and being in the garden.

The wild flowers down the lane at the side of the house continue to thrive.

We should see an explosion of flower heads over the next couple of weeks.

Already you can hear bees buzzing in them as you go by.

A couple of conversations today relating to the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/), which mean we'll have something a bit different to offer this year. The first planning meeting is tomorrow night so we have plenty to discuss.
