Met up with Graham for our regular monthly riverfly site check. We weren't expecting many deviations - it's normally a species rich site, but you never know until you start sampling what you might find.

This month Graham did the kick sampling, while I timed for three minutes. We could tell straight away looking at the bucket that there was a lot of life there. We recorded a score of 9, which I think is the highest we have seen at that site.

We were also lucky enough to see a fly ready to pupate. It was still on the water surface but had grown wings and looked as if it was ready to start learning how to take off. That's the first time I've seen that in a sample.
