Busy day today, starting with a task at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) to extend the goat pen prior to their arrival at the weekend. Chris and Jane from Glorious Grasslands also came down, which was a very useful extra pair of hands.

We have permission from the neighbouring field to shelter the goats in their field hut.

So the first job was to make a gap in the stock proof fencing so we could extend the fencing up about another 25 meters to the shelter.

Luckily Chris has done this sort of thing before so that was a straightforward task. We had three sets of 100m fencing of which 2 were already used. We were able to reposition and utilise the third set to extend the whole perimeter to circle the shed.

Unfortunately we had to cut a few plants in the new hedge. The roots are well established now after 18 months so hopefully they will grow back in time.

I had to leave site before lunch to attend an update meeting with the library on [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). We get together with staff every six months or so to review the progress and how it fits into the wider library strategies. I also found out information about a new programme in Stroud which I will lead a module on in September. The idea is for 16-24 year olds not in education or employment to build websites in Wordpress.

Afterwards, I then ran the regular Tuesday club where we had 7 attend. There was lots of different types of coding going on, so we had a noisy but productive session.
