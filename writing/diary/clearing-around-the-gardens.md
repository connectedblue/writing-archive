It was another fine day weather-wise at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) so a good opportunity to keep on top of general maintenance of some of the garden and amenity areas.

I brush cut the path areas of the Really Useful Garden which hopefully makes access to the beds much easier for the growers. I cut down the green manure section next to the art studio, which will need to be raked off, and perhaps that section may be rotivated further.

The kitchen revamp is almost complete and it's much safer now with the flooring and the heights of work surfaces. A couple of steps were added in today, and it's pretty much done.

My favourite roast potatoes were on the menu today. They are roasted in cumin, tumeric, cayenne pepper and salt and are very more-ish.

To go with that, was crunchy red cabbage and chickpea curry.

No code club today, so I didn't have to rush back after lunch. The afternoon was a bit more leisurely in the late afternoon sun.
