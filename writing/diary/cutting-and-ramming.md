The fencing project in the species rich grassland with [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) continued, with progress on several aspects. Almost all the scrub line is now cleared, but the arisings need to be stacked in a dead hedge, and the fence posts need to be rammed in.

Even though it's still early February, there's a concern that birds may be nesting very soon, so this could be the last change to cut back bramble encroaching on the grassland. I spent the morning in the small end meadow with the brush cutter to keep on top of the scrub there. I left some patches, particularly by the canal bank to provide habitat. But at the far end, I cut back to the fence line because there was acres of scrub on the other side and it was a natural stock proof barrier.

A major structural addition was made by Matt onto the end tension posts. Cross struts needed to be buried into the ground and post so that it doesn't move when tension is applied.

When we apply the wire, there will be long 30-40m stretches in between when the intermediate posts will not be taking tension.

Instead there is a special tool to stretch the wire taught from one tension post to another. So we need really solid posts when this is applied.

Luckily Matt has all the skills to put a very robust solution in place.

After lunch I helped to ram in the final posts in the main line at the top of the meadow. All the hard prep work with scrub clearance in previous weeks really paid off. We were able to easily and accurately line up all the intermediate posts and ram them into the ground to a height of 1.2m.

Like all aspects of the job, lines and levels were checked several times on each post to ensure a straight a fence as possible.

Hopefully it won't be too long now before the wire can be stretched across.
