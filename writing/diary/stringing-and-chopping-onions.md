Felt like another wintry day at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). Heavy rain most of the morning and a definite nip in the air. We welcomed two new people into the community team who had heard about the project from the permaculture groups in Stroud.

I'd not been down to the site for a few weeks, so it's always interesting to see what has been improved on the site.

Aside from the obvious increase in growing crops, it seems there has been a spurt of creative activities with sculptures from bicycle parts around the art studio.

Another delicious lunch

I spent the morning helping out in the kitchen. There were some onions to string up, and I chopped and washed up. Martin had prepared another delicious lunch of rice, dhal and spiced cauliflower.

In the afternoon I had another session of [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). A full house today with all eight PCs occupied. Four new children today, although two of them were extremely accomplished scratch coders. I'll have to start planning some python sessions for the autumn term.
