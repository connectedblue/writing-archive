"Did you know John Lennon got shot last night?"

John asked me this in the playground. I had no idea who John Lennon was. That was the whole topic at school that day.

Later in the afternoon, I caught up with the details on John Craven's Newsround. Apparently he was in the Beatles, who I had heard of. We had one of their albums in the collection next to the record player.

I told my Dad as he walked up the road returning from work that night. He was visibly shocked. He knew who John Lennon was.
