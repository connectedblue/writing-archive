We have a meadow at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) which is slowly being restored for wild flowers after several years of only occasional grazing. We're not in a position to have sheep just yet, so the next best thing is to cut very short just before the growing season.

We were a little late today, but the weather on the last few tuesdays meant it couldn't be done. So Martin got the tractor out and I did some more surgical cuts with the brushcutter in between the new fruit trees.

The strategy was not to cut the whole meadow, but make wide paths to encourage wildflower growths in part.

The hopper collects the grass as it cuts. This is the most important part of the process to remove nutrient from the meadow. It was dumped to the side in the dead hedge.

We were very fortunate to be joined by friends from Iran who cooked a splendid rice dish for lunch.

The dressing on the salad was sublime, and made from the simplest of ingredients: olive oil, lemon and salt.

The Code Club continued at Dursley library later in the afternoon. We have a very keen set of 8-12 year olds learning the Scratch programming language. A few of them are really motoring through the projects. A few new ones turned up today so they were started from the beginning.
