Decided this morning to go for a walk when I got up at 6am. I haven't done this in a long time and forgot how pleasant it is to be in beech woods at this time of day, at this time of year.

I've been developing an app to help [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) with the 2024 survey season. I met up with Anna and Lorna at a nearby farm to give it a field test before we unleash it on the wider survey team tomorrow.

The site was stunning - although it's close to my house, I hadn't walked this valley before. A top grade, species rich grassland in a very steep valley. Will, the owner, was very interesting and we had a long chat about how he's managing the land.

We did the first couple of quadrats together and made a lot of notes of small tweaks to improve the collection flow in the field. I left them at 1pm, because I had code club, but got accused of being a lightweight because it also happened to start raining then.

Held the usual session of [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the afternoon, which went well. The regulars continued to work on their website and some others practised scratch and python.

I returned to the PC later that evening and found 30 quadrats uploaded by Lorna and Anna. This all looked in good order, so I made the changes we agreed to the app, ready for the volunteer team tomorrow.
