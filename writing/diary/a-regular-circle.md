It's a walk I do often, especially during the warmer months, but each time there's something new to see during the growing season. The wild flowers are not yet all in flower, but the early celadine, forget me nots and dandelions are now giving way to red clover, hawksbeard and meadow buttercups.

The early blackthorn flowers have mostly gone and hawthorn is in full bloom.

I noticed the cows in a well hedged field chomping at the young hawthorn leaves.

Most trees are in full canopy and the horse chestnuts, for now, are in full flower.

Stopping off for tea and cake at the [Chantry Centre](https://www.chantrycentre.org/). Excellent Tiffin on offer today which I've not had in a while.

Tea and cake for two is Â£6.50, a bargain and helps to fund this important community facility.
