Went over to the River Cam sites for the regular fortnightly monitor of the rafts for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer).

For the second time in a row there were very distinct prints in the cartridge, as well as speint on the rafts.

It's probably the same otter heading downstream between the rafts, but good to get lots of evidence of their movements.

In the afternoon, headed over to the library for the Monday [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). Booked out again, and there was some interesting experimentation with the HTML that was powering a site which had a spin the wheel game. This club started out as mostly python and web, but now veers in all sorts of directions. The over arching aim is to inspire exploration of digital creativity.
