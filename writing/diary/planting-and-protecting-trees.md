Time to plant new apple trees in the Fromebridge orchard owned by [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). These saplings were reasonably mature so need careful planting, as well as protecting from grazing cattle.

The main task was to construct a 1.5m x 1.5m stock proof fence to surround the tree. A new spec for the orchard, this fence is more compact and higher than others we have constructed in the past.

It took four of us around three hours to put the fence together and plant the three.

Tim from the [Gloucestershire Orchard Trust](https://glosorchards.org/home/) was on hand to advise how to plant the trees correctly. The technique was to cut out turf in the shape of the root rather than dig a square hole.

There will be cattle grazing for a few weeks in the orchard before the growing season kicks in. This will be excellent preparation for the wildflowers we expect to see. But we don't want the cattle to eat the young tree which is why so much effort went into producing the stock proof fence.
