Headed back home at lunchtime, leaving Wales behind until next year. Having not seen my back garden for a week, I was intrigued to see what had come out and what had gone to seed.

A lot of the yellow rattle has gone to seed. A good sign because this year's seed harvesting for the [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) starts on Monday, and this is the main indicator species.

Although I'm letting them mostly drop naturally, there are some places I want to seed next season, so I picked some seed heads by hand.

The musk mallow was the one I noticed first coming through the back gate. The self heal has also flowered, except it's the tallest self heal I've ever seen. There are so many species packed into such a small area, they all out compete each other for light.

Down the lane, the purpletop vervain was looking spendid. This is the only plant of this type there, so I hope these seeds spread some more.

The nettles were looking bedraggled. I think the red admiral caterpillar has mostly finished so these can be cut down and hopefully a second flush will come this year to help out the later ones.
