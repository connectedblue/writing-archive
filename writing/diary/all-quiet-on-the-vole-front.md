A little bit later this week with my fortnightly river monitoring for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). The weather was terrible over the weekend and the start of the week, which would have washed any potential signs away. So I left a couple of clear days before wandering down today.

It turned out to be quieter than previous sessions. I saw possible signs of otter on two of the rafts. The otter speint is quite distinctive.

On the third raft where there was a load of activity in the last couple of months, it was bare. So whatever was there has clearly moved on.

I popped in to see Richard on the way back and helped him get the facebook page for [Dursley Rambling Club](https://www.dursleyramblingclub.co.uk/) up and running. This should help to improve the online presence for the club and draw distinctions with [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/).
