The [Cotswold Canals Connected](https://www.cotswoldcanalsconnected.org/) held their Spring Fair at Stonehouse Court Hotel and I agreed a while back to help out with the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) stall.

Pete and Anna had already set up the stall with displays about the role GWT is playing in the canal restoration to ensure biodiversity net gain.

It was a good opportunity to talk with the public about the improvements that will be seen along the canal over the next couple of years.

John from the [Arboricultural Association](https://www.trees.org.uk/) set up stall next to ours. I had some tree inspection training from there a couple of years ago.

He is super passionate about trees and I take every opportunity to go on one of his tree walks. Happily he did one today around the hotel grounds. Some fine examples including an arrangement of cut-leaf beech and birch.

We were given a delicious lunch of Moroccan Soup. Around 1.30, I made my way over to [Rodborough Village Hall](https://www.rodborough.gov.uk/bookable/community-hall) for the AGM of the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk). I was presenting a segment on the GWT canal project which the group had done many surveys for over the last year. A good opportunity to review feedback and plan this year's activities.

I also presented the [Griffiths Avenue](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/05/creeping-thistle-away/) potential project which I came across the other day. There was a lot of interest so I will pursue more with the team to see if we can make it happen.
