The final addition to the goat pen today at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) - a gateway to allow people safely in and out the pen. Martin had re-run some of the lines that we put in last week because they were too close to the ground. They were also secured better into the wooden posts with insulating rings.

It was a baking hot day, so Greg and I were careful to keep drinking water while out in the meadow.

We had to split the existing circuit to make the gateway and we created it with an electrified bungi rope that looped between the posts.

There weren't so many around at lunch time, maybe only six or seven of us. The hot weather had put a lot of people off I think. Martin cooked a delicious cauliflower curry with salad, all made with fresh ingredients from the polytunnel.

In the afternoon, I went to the library for the second [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) of the week. Another full house, with seven of the PCs in use. We managed to get everyone coding for a full 30 minutes before they succumbed to the heat and started playing games.
