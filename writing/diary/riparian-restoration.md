It was not a promising start to the day as the rain was torrential up until 9am and the road out the village was blocked with a fallen tree. But we met with [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) to continue work on the Fromebridge reserve.

There has been a change of plan regarding the water vole translocation which enables canal work to start. Originally the receptor site was going to be a series of ponds closer to the roundabout, but various issues have meant this would now take a long time to prepare. So, instead they will placed further down the canal near the small, species rich meadow that [we surveyed back in June](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/06/a-corky-fruited-day/).

This means that the riparian bank needs to be restored into a suitable habitat for water voles. The opposite bank will be done by machinery, but our task today was to remove the overhanging willow and bramble scrub which encroaches the reed and sedges on the bank. Water voles don't like making home in areas of bramble scrub.

Luckily the weather changed and although it didn't rain, it remained very humid the rest of the day.

There was a team of people working on the willow and the smaller hawthorns, so I went to the far corner with the brush cutter to tackle the denser scrub.

We want to retain the existing mature hawthorn and blackthorn, so it was a careful job to try and remove the bramble shoots low, without damaging the main stems. I was able to clear a good area around the tree which enabled the team with hand tools to target more precisely.

The temporary fencing at the far corner was breached by cattle over the summer, so we took the opportunity to create a giant dead hedge in front of it which should provide more protection.

In the end, we made excellent progress. There is still some restoration work to complete, but you can now see the shape of the bank and the demarcation between riparian and grassland is much more distinct.

In the afternoon, I went over to Bill's who wanted some advice on creating a grassland on his property. Unfortunately, it wasn't terribly suitable because of the woodland setting, but there were a few ideas to try in patches.
