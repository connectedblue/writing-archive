Some boundary maintenance today at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), where overgrown willow and hazel were blocking light to the green house.

The first task was to remove the willow to create a gap and allow the hazel to be coppiced for useful stake product.

It could be done with hand tools, but care was needed to ensure it didn't come crashing in on the greenhouse.

I was joined half way through by Andrew who heard about the project through Dursley Green Drinks. We managed to get some of the hazel coppiced, and the remainder will be done next week. The cut willow was laid in the existing dead hedge constructed earlier in the year.

Lunch today was a real feast. Every component was fresh from the polytunnel, except the pastry in the tart. Potatoes, salad, beetroot and vegetable tart, together with runner bean tempura. The menu was created by Cherie, assisted by our Iranian chef friend.

A key part of the Wild Acres experience is to eat together after a morning's work on the site, and with food and friends like this, who would want to be anywhere else on a Tuesday?

In the afternoon, I was off to the library for the weekly Code Club. We have a number of regulars now and they are all making excellent progress in their coding journey. Last week of term, but we have some more code club sessions planned for the summer holidays.
