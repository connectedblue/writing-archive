A number of things scheduled for today around my local community projects. In the morning we had another Visit Dursley meeting where we tackled the more focused question of Dursley's USP that should be highlighted to give people a reason to visit, live, work and invest.

These are difficult questions to tackle on almost zero budget, but we have strong assets in Heritage and Landscape that can form the backdrop. There are also active community organisations and business enablers which can work together to promote the town. The short term goal is a refresh of the town signage and maps, but a longer term strategy will be a dedicated visitor hub.

In the afternoon I held my regular [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). The monday club focuses on python and the children who attend are making incredible progress in their learning journey.

Immediately after I went to [The Engine](https://www.theengine.org.uk/) where we had a gathering of local traders to get to know each other and discuss issues of promoting the town. We were treated to a game in their Escape Room. I was in the moon landings game and we management to solve it in 40 minutes which we were very happy about.

The Escape Room is a fabulous experience and good value at Â£60 for six. Definitely a reason to visit Dursley.
