Dursley is the birthplace of the [Pedersen bicycle](https://www.dursley-pedersen.net/) and there are often activities to commerate this. Just happened to be hiking through and a cycle ride had stopped in the market place to display their bikes and answer questions.

There's a nice sense of history when you see the bicycles propped up against the same Market Place that Mr Pedersen himself would have propped his on.

Popped into the [Chantry Centre](https://www.chantrycentre.org/) which is a great place to get tea and cake on a Saturday morning in their garden cafe around the back.
