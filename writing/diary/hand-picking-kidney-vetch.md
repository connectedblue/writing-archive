Another shift today with the [Glorious Grasslands](https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/) project as the seed harvesting season continues to roll on. Bit of a hitch first thing when I turned up at a site in the Painswick valley, only to find no-one there. Seems as if there was a last minute venue change and I didn't receive the email last night.

Twenty minutes later I found myself in a beautiful meadow near Sapperton, ready for the days harvesting. One harvester is still broken, so we were a bit over staffed. The intermittent rain also slowed progress.

The kidney vetch in this field hadn't quite gone to seed, so the harvester wasn't picking it up. This is an important plant in meadow restoration because it reliably comes up when present.

So we decided to hand harvest the large clumps of kidney vetch all over the field. This involves taking the almost seeded head into a separate bag from the standard seed mix.

This will then be laid out to dry and handfuls can be added to the seed mix to provide a really good boost for those new meadows. It's a pretty labour intensive operation to hand harvest, but we managed to get a pretty decent sized bagful of seeds.

In the evening [The Engine](https://www.theengine.org.uk/) hosted a talk at Kingshill House about local business and social enterprises. There was some interesting discussion about what additional infrastructure Dursley needs, and whether it can be provided by Community Interest Companies. Hopefully something concrete will emerge from this over the coming months.
