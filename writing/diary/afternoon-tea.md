It was a day for catching up on admin. A referral to the physio to look at my arm; a call to the bank about the ongoing saga of my access to the [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) online account; baking the bread; writing minutes of the steering group meeting and planning the presentation for the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk/) AGM.

But mostly on days like this I prefer to get lost in technology rabbit holes. Today was all about putting automations into my server so I can do things like scheduled backups. There'll be a separate collection of articles about my server at some point. But I certainly spend longer configuring it than I do creating content.

Afternoon tea was scones, clotted cream and strawberry. By then the rain had stopped and the late evening sun brightened up the day.
