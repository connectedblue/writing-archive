This morning was a face to face meeting of the Visit Dursley group in the town council offices. We meet once a quarter over zoom and discuss how best to encourage more visitors to the town. But sometimes it's just better to be face to face, so we met in the historic Jacob's House in Dursley (location of the town council offices).

There were five of us, and we reviewed the new town centre maps, discussed the e-bike scheme and worked out a way to connect the town centre with the art trail at the back of the woods.

A new piece of woodland has just been purchased, so it gives more options to make clearer pathways for visitors so they don't get lost. We can put in some more roundels and posts, and produce some dedicated leaflets.

In the afternoon I held the regular python [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. We had all eight PCs in use again, and everyone made strides in their ongoing projects. Not really any new children these days - the sessions are all booked out by regulars.
