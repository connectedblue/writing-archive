After the last few weeks diversions at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/) getting ready for the developing roots day, I got the chance to return to the other end of the meadow to continue the hazel coppicing.

There are quite a few mature trees in that corner which can be selectively managed to stimulate future product growth, remove shading from the meadow and clear a path by the brook to create a connecting circular walk around the site.

Nick and I took a few tools and tidied up the harvested bundles and stacked the remaining brash [from last time](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/02/coppicing-mature-hazel/) into a dead hedge.

As we started to work on the next tree, it became clear how a nice path could be created to connect with one lower down the site.

This will enable visitors to explore the whole perimeter of the site along the brook and then down by the new hedge. There's quite a bit of work still to do - there's rubbish in the brook itself which needs removing and some old fencing in the undergrowth. There's also a couple of spidery willow that will need chainsaw removal.

I went over the plan with Martin, who agreed to the work. I'll put it down in the management plan, and set about doing it over the next few weeks. There's quite a lot to do, so I'll see if I can recruit some friends from other projects who might want to help.

In the afternoon, I went down to the library for the [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). Unfortunately, the major problems from yesterday were still present and we weren't able to reliably login to the coding sites. So the children had an hour playing games instead, which they seemed super happy about. Hopefully I can get their interest back to coding next week.
