Now is the time of year when farmers try to stimulate growth in their meadows. You may have noticed the stripped effect on fields. They are using a harrow. Not to get a bowling green finish, but to create slits for air and water.

Always new things to look at, even on familiar routes. It's great to see the community vegetable plot coming together with this year's crop.

Stopped off at the [Chantry Centre](https://www.chantrycentre.org/) for the usual tea and cake. Outside today because of the dog show inside, but the weather in the morning was like pure summer so it didn't matter.

The [Dursley Climate Action Network](https://www.facebook.com/DursleyCAN/) were meeting so I popped over to say hello. I'm helping to launch an informal "Green Drinks" regular social event in May so that was a good opportunity to network. A pretty good action plan is emerging and [Kingshill House](https://www.kingshillhouse.org.uk/) are willing to become the centre for future events that the group organise.
