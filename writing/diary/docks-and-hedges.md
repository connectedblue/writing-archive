A bit of important meadow restoration work this morning at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). There are a number of dock - not too many but we don't want to spread much further. The seeds are getting towards ripeness, so a few of us spent the first hour or so snipping the heads into a wheelbarrow. These could be disposed off in some scrub away from the grassland and will mean that they won't set new seed in the meadow.

I then had the task of clearing the triangular vegetable patch behind the dead hedge with the brush cutter.

I did this earlier in the year, but you wouldn't know. It was a jungle of butter burr and all sorts in there.

Cherie cooked up a marvellous curry for lunch, then I headed off down to Dursley Library for another code club. This was full again, and one new boy attended who was super knowledgable about Scratch, so I watched him as he talked his way through the projects to try and assess where his knowledge was. I have a feeling he might be one of the future stars before too long.

In the evening we had the admin meeting for the [Stroud Wildlife Survey Group](https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk). There were only four of us, but we managed to rattle through the agenda in about 40 minutes.
