There are many social days at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), but the christmas meal is always one to look forward to and the best way to celebrate and round off the year. This year was slightly different as we all brought small parts of the meal, so they only needed to be heated up and served. There were over 20 people present so this is the best way to produce the quantity of food without one or two people needing to cook today.

The first part of the morning was coffee and homemade biscuits from Solveig. The annual report was read by Vicky and different highlights discussed.

There were many, many projects and experiences, but the stand out memory was the welcome and integration of the refugees in the local area into the wild acres family.

We then split into three groups and brainstormed three ideas: What we love about WA, what we don't like so much and what we'd like more of. This will be useful for the directors to synthesise into a plan which can be shown to funders.

Around 1pm the lunch was heated up and ready to be served buffet style. The food was amazing, each dish was so well prepared and tasty. Nut roast was the centrepiece, but all the usual roasted vegetables and side dishes that you would expect.

Afterwards there were mince pies from Diane and my fig pudding. It was my first attempt at a steamed pudding, and encouraged by the reaction, I'll add it to my repertoire.

A mountain of washing up as usual but with plenty of hands it didn't take too long to complete. In the end, the weather wasn't too bad and certainly better than the torrent of rain that greeted us at 10am
