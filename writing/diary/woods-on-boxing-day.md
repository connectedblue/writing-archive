The weather has been windy and rainy over the christmas holiday so far, but an unexpected break on boxing day was a good opportunity for a walk.

There are so many paths and routes to take in the local area, it's possible to stitch together a huge variety of walks.

Today I felt like both a stretch and quiet so I took the high path into the woods and created a 6.5 mile circular.

The paths were surprisingly easy underfoot given the volume of rain. It must drain away easily to the lower valley.

It was a little surprising not to see anyone at all. These woods are barely used in general, but I thought some might venture out to walk off the excess of the past few days.

While out today, it occurred to me that I haven't really walked all that much this year, outside of the events for [Dursley Welcomes Walkers](https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/). I'll have to make a new year resolution to carve out time once a week for a hike.
