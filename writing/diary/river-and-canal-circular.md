The final day of the holiday and something more gentle was in order. A four mile circular around the river and canal through Llangynidr.

It was a bit more challenging than a stroll along the river section.

The path was stony, close to the edge and clambering was required in places. I can quite easily imagine this route would have been impassable in the higher waters of the last few weeks.

Half way around, another excellent opportunity to stop at the village cafe for tea and cake.
