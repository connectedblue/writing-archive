The car was booked in for an annual service, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to walk around Gloucester while it was being done.

The canal is a short walk from the garage and that provides a pleasant walk right to the middle of the city. There were a surprising amount of wild flowers in patches along the bank, so a good management plan must be in place.

Most of the city south of the centre is sadly devoid of much vegetation. But I was rather surprised to come across a wildflower patch in the unlikeliest of scrub areas next to a busy road.

I stopped by a busy cafe for a nice lunch and cup of tea before returning to pick up the car
