The grass is getting longer now, the seeds have dropped and we are moving into the season of managing the habitats to improve for next year.

Luckily the brush cutter has now been fixed, so I was able to use the strimming head to cut back grass on either side of the new hedge. The tractor will cut the main meadow soon, so we need a marker of short grass so that it doesn't come too close to the hedge.

Unfortunately the strimmer head sheared off at one point. The plastic casing gave way, and left a bolt stuck which couldn't be removed. Luckily Martin is very handy with an angle grinder and it was soon back working again with a fixed blade.

We were served the most delicious lunch by our Sri Lankan friends.

You really can't beat fresh ingredients, well cooked food and sitting with friends in the heat of the sun.

I had to leave early though, so skipped washing up duty.

In the afternoon, I continued the Web programming [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) in the library. We had seven children attending, including two new ones who got up to speed with making simple websites very quickly.

It's been a challenge running this over the summer, mainly in pitching the material in a way that makes sense for them to quickly grasp and experiment with. Last night I met someone at the Dursley Green Drinks who would love to come and help. So that will hopefully allow us to put on some more flexible options going forward.
