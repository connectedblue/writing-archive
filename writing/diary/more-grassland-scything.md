This time of year at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/), the main task is to cut the grassland areas which have now dropped all the seed they're going to. I took the scythe again because I want to keep practising the technique.

The first task though was to clear the rubbish which had accumulated on the grass area between the gate and kitchen. Various bits of metal, wood, tools and plastic were buried in the long grass. I also took the chance to tidy up the wood stack area which I'd done earlier in the year.

So it was late morning before I started scything in earnest. The layers came off easily, and you can now see the fruit trees again. However, I badly damaged the scythe blade on a stone, chipping a chunk out of the central part. It is repairable, but I need a few more tools. I think I'll call in on Toby who has an ample workshop which should be up to the task.

Cherie cooked yet another amazing tasting meal, with a rich pesto dressing. I washed up afterwards, but then had to head off at 2pm sharp, so I could get ready for the afternoon Code Club.

The first Tuesday session of [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub) has been fully booked all term, with many on the waiting list. However, three didn't turn up which is annoying. Luckily Eleanor had come along on the off chance so was able to use a spare PC. I had some new attendees today, so a good opportunity to get them started off with scratch.

In the evening, I finally completed my submission for the Long Street Car Park environmental land management plan. A long standing action which I had done all the prep for, but just needed to find time to complete. It's a relief to get it in before the group meeting on Thursday.
