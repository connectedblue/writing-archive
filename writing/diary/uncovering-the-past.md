It's coming to the end of the brush cutting season, at least for scrub areas at [Wild Acres](https://wildacres.org.uk/). The birds will be nesting from now so those areas can't be disturbed. I finished off down by the brook, and the whole scrub clearance must have freed up around quarter of an acre.

I also carried on cutting in the ditch behind the Really Useful Garden.

At one point, a lot of sparks revealed something metal buried into the ditch bank.

Turned out it was an old blade which Martin has mislaid years ago. It will now adorn the gabon which I constructed a few months ago.
