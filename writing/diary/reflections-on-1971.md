When I woke up, there was a present at the end of my bed. I didn't really know why. It was a Dougal puppet from the magic roundabout. I woke up Katy in the bed next to me who also had one. Hers was Brian (the snail).

My paternal nanna opened the door. She said that mummy was coming home later that day.

Later on, we went downstairs and everyone was in the living room. My mum was holding a bundle and I went up to take a look. There was a baby in it.

This was the house in Burrows Close, Bookham.
