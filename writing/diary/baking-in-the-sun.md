One of the hottest days of the year, so spent time alternating between the garden and the kitchen. Usually I bake bread on a Friday, but yesterday was full on with [the course](https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/06/a-brush-with-training/), so I did it this morning.

You can never quite tell how the prove will be in the heat. I left in a shaded place, and it seemed to rise at the right pace.

I slice it up and freeze straight away. It contains no preservatives so would be stale in a couple of days otherwise.

A busy day in the village. There is a wedding a reception close by so cars are parked everywhere. The church organ and bells could be heard in the distance.
