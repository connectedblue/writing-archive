Much longer walk today of about 17km. The route was over the high moorland down to Gunnerside, followed by another climb over to Muker and the Pennine Way back to Keld.

The first part followed the Coast to Coast trail so the path was very clear up the steep valley past ruined mine buildings. It then veered off across the usual non-path over the top towards Gunnerside. There was a very nice circular stone shelter for morning tea.

A striking thing about the landscape is the huge network of dry stone walls that divide up the pasture.

They must represent thousands of hours of labour per hillside, and they are everywhere.

The cost to farmers must have been huge to create such large infrastructure.

Lunch was down near Gunnerside next to a beautifully secluded river, lined by rows of mature Alder.

Afterwards there was a stunning, but steep climb up the other side of the road to come to a nice contour path which leads round to Muker.

Luckily there was a spare table in the tea shop at Muker. It was very busy for an October Tuesday afternoon, but the tea was hot and the cakes really good. This was a good refuel before the finish pull up the Pennine Way high route back to Keld.

By now, the weather was whipping up a bit. Severe storms are expected over the next few days, so this could be the last hike on the high ground.
