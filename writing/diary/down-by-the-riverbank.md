It was time again for the fortnightly check on three river rafts for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). The last couple of times have not really shown any signs, but today there was otter speint on one and possible water vole footprints on another.

Not super compelling evidence, but worth keeping an eye on over the next month or so. The raft furthest upstream has not seen any activity for a couple of months now.

In the afternoon, I had a flu jab appointment and then retrieved the remaining window display material for the [Dursley Walking Festival](https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/) from shops and the library.

Then it was the usual Tuesday Scratch code club in the library after school. A full house today, all 8 PCs were in use. No new children today, so they progressed nicely with their current projects.
