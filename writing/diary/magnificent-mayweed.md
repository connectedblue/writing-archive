Time again for the regular check of river rafts for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer). This is a route I walk regularly and it's always interesting to note the changes with the seasons.

I was struck today by the line of white willow. This was heavily pollarded last year, but as willow does, it recovers very quickly. The canopy was huge and rounded - not at all like the more familiar weeping willow.

The mayweed was out in full force. I don't know if this is the last of the wild flowers to flower, but it must be one of the last.

It's an under appreciated plant I think. Perhaps because it flowers so late. But they certainly gave the river bank a different look.

No signs of anything on the rafts though. I wonder if the breeding season is coming to an end? At least there are no American mink. These are the destructive, invasive species that have contributed to the decline of water voles.
