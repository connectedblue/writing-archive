Another work party in the orchard for the [Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer) to undertake winter maintenance tasks. Today I was brushcutting two areas of bramble. The first was next to a new fence line, where new growth was starting to encroach. Last year this whole section was thick with bramble which we had to remove to allow the fence to be installed.

So it was relatively quick to do. Or should have been had I not accidentally clipped barb wire and severed the top of the fence.

We didn't have the fencing toolkit with us, but luckily Mike had fencing pliers and a hammer in his car. There was also a short piece of barb in the truck, so we managed to make a temporary repair and get the tension back on the fence line.

After the tea break I started on a new patch on the other side of the orchard which hadn't been tackled at all in the last few years of restoration. This was about head height, so I adjusted the brush cutter handles so I could sweep down from above my head and mulch. We weren't cutting all the way to the boundary, we definitely want to retain a soft edge habitat for wildlife. But cutting this section reclaimed another 50 square metres or so for the grassland to grow into.

It's hard to remember that just a couple of years ago, large parts of the orchard had scrub this high. Now there is grass and other vegetation growing instead, although we will need to keep on top of small bramble clumps that are starting to form again in pockets.

In the afternoon I went over to the village church where there was a fund raiser for the under 5 playgroup. It was good to bump into a few people, one of whom was a parish councillor who told me that the biodiversity plan for the village had been accepted in a formal vote this week. This means we can start some work parties to restore the common area at the top of the hill.
