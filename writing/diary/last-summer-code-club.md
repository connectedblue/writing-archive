Went down to the Library this morning to hold the last of three summer code clubs for [Dursley Code Club](https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub). The challenge this year was Sport, so in an hour and a half we had the challenge of building a sports website from scratch.

There were 6 children today which brings the total to 18 over the holidays who all have a live website on neocities.org with a two page content and design which they had come up with.

We were coding HTML and CSS pages - no wordpress or other shortcuts. Despite the difficulties with typing precise code, they all amazed me with their creativity and persistence in creating a site. They also added copyright friendly images from Getty and added youtube videos.

I think they all were inspired by actually having a web page they can put whatever they want on. This is is whole point of the club - to inspire the next generation to explore digital creativity, and not just use computers to consume.

If you would like to get your child interested in coding websites, you are welcome to follow the simple [course instructions outlined here](https://dursleycodeclub.trinket.io/sports-website#/setting-up/set-up-neocities).
