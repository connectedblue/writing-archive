Recently I had an email exchange with [Chris Lovie-Tyler Art](https://chrislt.art/) on why [I'm not on google](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/not-on-google/), so I thought I'd expand on the reasons here.

The reason started out through annoyance but has since developed into a more nuanced strategy.

I was on the Google console for a year with my diary. I had about 200 posts but Google only indexed about half of them and kept complaining about the others. Despite everything I tried, I couldn't ever get the full set indexed.

For example, it would flag a diary entry (which, by definition, was unique to me, photos and all) and say "this is not the canonical version".

In the end, I thought to myself "screw you". If you're not going to index them all, then you can't index any.  I don't want you to randomly decide what's important.

So I added `noindex, nofollow` to all content coming from the `uncountable.uk` domain. From now on, I only want to be stumbled upon, not regurgitated from some big tech algorithm.

I'm doubling down on being discovered in indie web.  I have [elevated the RSS experience](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/elevate-your-websites-rss-feed/) recently for subscribers and see that as the primary channel to focus on. 

My main RSS feed and homepage will become a more considered place.  If someone has gone to the trouble of adding my URL to their reader, I don't want to repay that by throwing out six random things in rapid succession and then nothing for days. 

My primary concern is the RSS audience, which means curating a schedule of content that is a bit more intentional.  I'm also making RSS only content that doesn't appear anywhere else in the website navigation.

I still publish random stuff elsewhere in the site - I just make sure wordpress excludes it from the home and RSS feeds to keep them more predictable for readers.

I also participate in blog carnivals, reply to other blog posts and put my blog in as many indie web directories as possible.  It is an experiment in being small and focused and community oriented.  It's not about clicks and eyeballs for me.

But, I'm not looking to monetise in any shape or form.  So it's not a strategy that would suit everyone.

I honestly don't think google, FB, linkedin could enhance my digital life.  I don't want to conform to their notion of "what makes good content". They could go away or change the rules or anything. 

I just get enormous satisfaction from [writing my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/), blogging and interacting with people.

In any case, I actually have a much, much bigger audience goal than google could provide anyway. I want to be capable of [being read in 200 years](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/) time.

I haven't made any progress towards that yet, but I'll keep you updated.
