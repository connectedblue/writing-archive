Just stumbled into Matthew Taylor's article on creating [custom HTML tags](https://matthewjamestaylor.com/custom-tags) which I want to start applying as a way to structure more complex blog post content in a way that doesn't embed WP theme specific information.

His site also has some rather simple and brilliant responsive layout markup patterns.
