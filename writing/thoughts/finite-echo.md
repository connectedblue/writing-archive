In reply to Jack "[I'm tired of all of us](https://daily.baty.net/posts/2024/05/16/I-m-tired-of-all-of-us.html)", part of the problem is that human imagination and creativity is finite. There are only so many things to dwell on.

In my post on the [size of the finite possibilities](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/finite-is-quite-large/), I postulated a thought experiment which consisted of a video library with all possible DVDs of length three hours or less. This is a large, but finite library.

This library will contain copies of a film of two humans sitting in opposite chairs discussing every possible concept that can be expressed in three hours or less. A mind blowingly large number of DVDs, but still finite.

Although, in practical terms, Jack probably can find another topic that isn't just an echo. I'll still be subscribing to his RSS, and look forward to a new seam of content opening up.
