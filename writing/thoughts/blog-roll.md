It's quite common for blogs to recommend a list of other blogs to check out.

My blog roll is slightly different. I follow many different blogs and always have something interesting to read in my RSS reader. So I'm sharing that with you instead.

This list changes every day. Enjoy exploring whichever headlines grab your interest . . .
