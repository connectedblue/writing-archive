I had to grit my teeth through this first article of the influences section. Chemistry is not a subject I have innate curiosity for, and consequently I have very little background knowledge, beyond my O level taken in 1985.

But unsurprisingly, the structure of compounds, crystals and bigger structures have a lot of group theory, differential geometry and algebra underpinning. It seems a lot of classification work with mathematical objects produces results which concur with observations in nature. Yet another example of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.

There's been a distinct shift in the last few decades from viewing compounds as crystals (and quasi crystals) towards surfaces and textures which can be modelled by complex analysis.

There's a specific type of surface called a Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) which appears in a huge number of chemical structures. These can be analysed using tools developed by Weierstrass in the 1860s. Again, an example of pure mathematics developed for it's own sake which can find application centuries later.

I don't feel any more enthused about chemistry after completing this article, but feel like I have a few more examples I can throw around in conversation.
