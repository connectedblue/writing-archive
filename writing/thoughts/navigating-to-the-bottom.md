While browsing [Lea's site](https://lea.verou.me/) , I noticed on mobile view that the hamburger menu icon at the top of the page jumps to a menu laid out at the bottom of the page in the footer.

This is a brilliant piece of design. Navigation on almost all websites follows the same pattern - clickable menus in the header to take you to different parts of the website.

But not on mine, you'll notice. I deliberately place the menu at the bottom of the page, which gives the visitor a chance to read the content in peace before deciding whether they want to explore the site further.

So I offer only a dark-light toggle button for reader preference at the top. I want there to be as few barriers as possible between someone clicking and then reading.

But I've now upgraded my header to also include the hamburger icon as well. This is universally recognised as being a menu button, so if the reader does want to see what else is on offer, they can press it. Otherwise, it stays out the way.

There's a lot more innovation to be done with website navigation I think. We are still using the same patterns as the 90's, even though content structures are an order of magnitude more complex now.

So, inspired by Lea, I'm hoping this small change will allow people who want to navigate do so more quickly. But without distracting those who do want to just read.

I've gone a little "off-piste" from a UX perspective though by including the hamburger on the desktop view as well. This icon is usually reserved for mobile to save screen space, so people might find it weird to click with a mouse.
