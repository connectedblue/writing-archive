I only have 170 posts on this blog but already I can't keep track of articles I've already written. Quite often I have the sense of having written an idea before, but I can't find the reference.

I try to treat my posts as a wiki where I can, cross linking ideas instead of repeating them. But I have no idea what system I can use when I reach 500, 1000, 2000 posts.
