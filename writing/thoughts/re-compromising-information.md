Tracy has compiled a very good series of posts on [connecting the indie web](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/06/28/compromising-information/) that explores all the different ways human connection is supported and where it might all be heading next.

It's a long read, spread over posts written at different points in time, but the overarching argument is best summarised by this:

> My wish is for the IndieWeb to [enable _and encourage_ connection](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/21/taking-opportunities-to-connect/) between indie website publishers and readers, allowing conversations and [other types of interaction](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/07/30/playing-together-online-reimagining-interactions/). My vision is strengthening and broadening the IndieWeb community. **I want the IndieWeb to be a viable alternative to social media**, gradually widening the audience beyond tech-savvy folks by making the tools easier to use and more reliable.

My position on this has evolved recently and I currently view this blog as part of [the independent web](/independent-vs-indie-web). I don't want to boil the ocean with the full slate of indie web components. Instead, all my effort on this website goes into two areas: writing and the [reader experience](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/).

Writing is the main thing, and I do this whenever I have the urge to unload what is in my head. However, I don't put these posts straight onto the home page - there are various categories and sections around this site where writing can fit.

The reader experience is where I do a little bit of activism. I would prefer if people [read my work in RSS](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/id-rather-you-didnt-read-this/), rather than directly on the website. The two principle reasons for taking this stance are:

- if you don't already have an RSS reader, your digital life will be improved greatly [by getting one](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/). Then you can read my posts and hundreds of others.

- if you add me to your reader, then you are more likely to read more of my posts over the longer term.

To support this approach, I've committed to readers that they will get a predictable experience. One post per day at 6am UK, and possibly one other at 6pm occassionally. Additionally, if you subscribe over RSS, you'll get some additional content at the end of each post, and occasionally RSS only posts.

In the couple of months I've been doing this, I've noticed an increase in connection on both my [guest book](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guest-book/) and over email. I don't feel at all like I'm blogging into a vacuum, so I will keep up this strategy for as long as I feel that way.

But if you want to see the indie web in all it's glory, head over to Tracy's post and start clicking on a few links - you'll soon end up in a rich tapestry of human interaction that you haven't got a chance of experiencing if you never venture outside your favourite social media app.
