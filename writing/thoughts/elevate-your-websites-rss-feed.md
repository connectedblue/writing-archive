How much thought do you give to the RSS feed on your blog?

I suspect a lot of people don't realise they even have one. But for the many that do, have you tailored your feed to create a more personal and engaging experience for your RSS subscribers?

My preference is for people [to read my content via RSS](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/id-rather-you-didnt-read-this/), so I've been taking a number of steps to try and elevate that experience. It's a real honour to have someone add my URL to their reader, so I want to earn the right to stay there.

The steps I have taken recently are:

- Schedule one article every single day at 6am UK time. And optionally do one more at 6pm. Previously I would write and publish which might mean 4 articles one after the other, then nothing for three days. So now, a more consistent and calmer flow can be expected.

- Include a short footer below every RSS article where I can write some additional content.

- Say thanks for subscribing! And ask them to send me their RSS feed so I can include it in mine.

- Give a small teaser of what content might be coming next. This is easy now that posts are scheduled well in advance.

- Create single theme content spread over several days, like my [recent week focusing on investment strategy](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/july-2024-principles-of-investing-week/). Advertise it in advance so readers know what to expect.

- Include two links to other blogs that I have read in the last couple of days that I enjoyed. This is just the two latest items in the favourites folder in my RSS reader, so it just updates automatically.

- Finally, publish RSS only content - like this post! It will exist in my blog as a post, but won't be linked anywhere in the navigation. So RSS subscribers get access to something that other visitors do not.

I'm committed to keeping to this strategy over the lifetime of this blog. Some people have email newsletters and take a lot of care in producing good content for their subscriber's inbox. Well, I want to take equal care in delivering the best I can for your RSS reader.

It means I will spend more time considering content, and curating it into a consistent feed that is hopefully easier for readers to digest.
