JRN posted about their methodology for finding [interesting new content](https://jrn.sh/post/how-i-find-interesting-blogs) and whether people really add from blog directories.

As it happens, I discovered their blog through the new entry RSS feed for [blogroll.club](https://blogroll.club/) . I saw the site, liked the content and added it to my reader. Then I saw that post and felt I had to respond!

I wrote about the feeds that [Lou and Jedda offer](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/blog-roll-club/) a couple of weeks back. They have enhanced the blog directory concept by offering dynamic feeds in addition to the static list. This morning I saw their update post on new blogs added, checked them out and updated my reader.

I also put their [aggregated feed](https://www.inoreader.com/stream/user/1005111300/tag/A%20Blogroll) into a separate category called Hosepipes in my reader. This is essentially every post in their directory that has been published recently. I hide this from my main feed, otherwise it would dominate (and it also contains duplicates of many posts I follow anyway). But that category is useful to go into from time to time and discover a new blog to follow.

I do agree with JRN in general though, that people are not trawling through alphabetic directory lists looking for new stuff. Mostly I add new sources when I stumble across links in other blogs. This kind of contextual cross linking remains the most powerful discovery mechanism we have on the independent web.

There is still a lot of innovation to be made in search and discovery outside of algorithmic tech giants. Jedda and Lou have made a nice step forward in enriching that ecosystem.
