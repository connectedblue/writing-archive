In response to [Michelle's post](https://css-irl.info/rss-is-good-isnt-it/), RSS is jolly good indeed.

I honestly don't even visit news sites like the BBC anymore. There are over 250 RSS feeds in my reader, organised into categories and it's very easy to digest. Sometimes I read news, sometimes magazines, but mostly it's other blogs. Real posts written by real people.
