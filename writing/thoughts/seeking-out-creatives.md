The large blogging platforms such as wordpress, substack, eleventy, hugo etc are well known. But they all have an entry barrier set high enough to deter a lot of people who just want to write and create.

The rise of low cost hosted solutions like [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/) and [bear](https://bearblog.dev/) fill a fabulous gap because not only do you get up and running easily, there is also a community built in which can syndicate your writing to a wider audience.

One feed which I have been following is [smol.pub](https://smol.pub/manual). It's a small journal site that has the feel of a village pub community. I follow [their atom feed](https://smol.pub/atom.xml) in my reader and all sorts of notes crop up from time to time from different people on the platform..

One such person was [Zak](https://zkbro.smol.pub/) who started writing on smol about his journey learning linux CLI tools to create a new website. He exuded a curiosity and creativity in how he went about this so I naturally started to follow posts on [html-chunder](https://html-chunder.neocities.org/) - the new website he was building on the neocities platform.

I think the result looks amazing, especially when you read how it's created underneath - using CLI scripts to create posts on the command line, zola for site generation and neocities CLI to upload the result.

But this morning I saw his latest post about creating an image for the website header section which is a stitched together graph of his exercise stats from Strava over the last seven days.

Such a creative and personal way to add some dynamic interest to your website design. He's learned a whole ton of stuff, but it all started because smol.pub gave him a simple starting point to journal out to the world. I would certainly have not discovered his site otherwise.

There are thousands of creators doing really innovative things all across the web. You're not going to stumble into them by clicking around facebook or google.

In my view, the best way to discover these gems is to liberally add sources to your RSS reader at every opportunity. They will deliver you nuggets of gold.
