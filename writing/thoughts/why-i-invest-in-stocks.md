My investment journey since 1996 has been solely to invest in publicly traded companies. And for the majority of that time, the investments have been in [passive index funds](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/choosing-a-passive-strategy/) tracking major markets in the UK and US.

The basic reason for this is that companies are the entities that provide the bulk of economic activity. Look around in the room where you are at the moment. I think you would struggle to find an item that wasn't produced by a company. The small bookshelf on my floor was supplied by a small company in Bristol. It's a private company, but a company nevertheless.

Publicly traded companies are a subset of all companies, but the advantage of choosing to invest in them is liquidity. I can buy and sell small pieces of a company whenever I choose in the market.

I also can't really foresee a time in the future when the bulk of economic activity is conducted by entities other than public companies. I also believe that economic activity is going to continue to grow over the next few decades (when I will be around).

This leads on to the next topic. Just because a company is important for economic activity, it does not follow at all that investing in it will make you wealthy. However, they are very likely to protect your capital against inflation.

Core inflation is caused by rising prices of goods and services in the economy. This means that the revenue of companies is increasing in line with prices. Similarly, company expenses are also likely to rise with inflation. So earnings (revenue less expenses) will increase in line with inflation, all other things being equal.

Since share prices are a discounted valuation of those expected future earnings, they should also rise in line with inflation. The combination of inflation and growth should deliver a real return on your portfolio over the long term.

The obvious next question is how do you know which companies will exhibit this behaviour, because some will and some won't.

The honest answer is that I haven't got the faintest idea which companies will do well over the next few decades. So I invest in every single company in the market (US and UK) so that my portfolio return matches the [overall market return](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/).

You should never invest in things you don't understand. I've spent a lot of time trying to understand what companies are and how they contribute in general to wealth creation. So, for me, they are likely to be the only asset class I invest in for the remainder of my life.
