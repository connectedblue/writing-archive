I have over 600 feeds in my RSS reader, around 75% are blogs of some sort and the remainder news sites and youtube subscriptions. I use it several times a day as a way of [owning my own scroll](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/own-your-scroll/).

My platform is a self hosted version of [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/index.html) which gives ample flexibility. It has a great feature where you can just review all the feeds with errors.

Just spent half an hour cleaning up about 15 feeds that had problems, ranging from websites disappearing completely to changes in the RSS url. I even dropped a note to one author who appeared to have a certificate expiry.

Well worth doing. The server is set to query every six hours - partly because I want to be a good RSS citizen and query as little as possible. But also to prevent me chasing my own scroll.

So a little bit of housekeeping keeps things shipshape and functional. I add new feeds liberally (usually from links in existing posts) but prune back only rarely.

It's a feed I feel in control of.
