I know for sure you're reading this with a reader (go ahead, try clicking on this article link to read on the web ...). I'm also pretty sure you also have your own blog. Hopefully I'm following yours (I have 600+ in my reader so there's a sporting chance, but [drop me a note](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/contact-me/) with your feed if you want to check!)

How about starting your own RSS Club? Make some of your posts only available to RSS subscribers (like this one).

Dave Rupert is the [godfather of RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/2018/01/welcome-to-rss-club/), but you can also start your own. Like he says, he literally can't stop you. I had a recent exchange with Evan about his secret posts, and he [started his own](https://daverupert.com/2018/01/welcome-to-rss-club/) as a result.

Mine is a [bit more extreme](/topic/rss-only/). You literally can't view any of my RSS club posts online. But most people don't - the links are there for people to navigate to from their readers (they're just not available in the archives or home page of their site).

It's a good and easy way to give some exclusive content to those who have taken the trouble to add your feed to their reader. In my opinion, it's way better than an email newsletter.

If you have wordpress, you only need to add a small amount of code to your site to achieve this. I wrote a [tutorial on how you can do this](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/fine-tuning-post-display-in-wordpress/) (not an RSS only post so you can actually view it!).

Whatever you do, don't forget the first rule of RSS Club . . .
