Once you have stopped work, time suddenly becomes a central asset in your life. Indeed, it may even be the reward you were striving for. There's a good chance that spending it wisely will [increase happiness](/what-is-happiness), but only if you [allocate it well](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/).

I use an online calendar to allocate my time. There are actually two pleasures - the first is deciding to put something in the calendar. Only things I truly want to do go in. The second is, of course, doing the activity itself.

The system works well for two reasons - firstly is that I do actually look at the calendar daily and always have a structure in my head of what the forthcoming week looks like. And secondly because I always write an entry the moment I agree to do something. So it's always up to date.

If there are potential dates to hold for something, I'll mark both those in. I have very few recurring appointments. [Wild Acres](https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/wild-acres/) is one that I do almost every Tuesday. But I do book things well in advance. Most projects I'm involved with issue a schedule for the next three months dates fill quickly.

I also try to only book one thing per day (and sometimes an evening event, although that is rare). Overall, this system means that I have an going structure, and since covid, there's not been a single week when I haven't had at least three activities per week (except holidays).

But among all the over commitments on the calendar, there are still runs of days when I have zero or very small appointments. These days I look forward to as well because I don't decide what to do right until the last minute. And of course, some time is just spent looking at the wall.

I'm very careful to use the word calendar to refer to future events. I also [keep a diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) where I document the main things I have done on certain days. The empty calendar days usually do not get a diary entry.

Since stopping work in 2019, I've never once had the feeling of frittering away time. Nor have I ever felt remotely like I'd prefer to be working. And I've not been bored.

It takes some effort to manage, but I believe if you can allocate time well, you can get the most out of the remaining amount we have left.
