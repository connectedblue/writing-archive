I hope you enjoyed reading some of my thoughts on investing over this past week. As a reminder, we looked at the following topics:

- [Why accumulate wealth?](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-accumulate-wealth/)

- [What is Financial Independence?](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/)

- [Most important factors for accumulating wealth](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/)

- [Saving vs Investing](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/saving-versus-investing/)

- [What is risk?](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-risk/)

Please remember I am not a financial advisor, and these are simply my perspectives after 25 years of investing. Your journey and considerations will differ from mine.

However, I do believe you should ask yourself all these questions and formulate answers relevant to yourself. Your financial outcomes will be improved if you are intentional with your decisions.

If you want to explore more on this topic, you can read a fuller [set of articles on investing](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-reading-list-for-investing/) here.

I welcome feedback from this little "mini-series". It was an experiment this week to present content to you in a different way, and hopefully get you thinking about money in new ways.

Please send me an email on [chris@uncountable.uk](mailto:chris@uncountable.uk) with your thoughts on these topics, or anything else you'd like me to cover in future.
