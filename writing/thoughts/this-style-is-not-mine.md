Around March 2024, I started to spend a lot more time on the IndieWeb. I had been keeping a [blog diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) for about a year. This has been a great experience for me, and I plan to keep it going.

At the same time, I had an urge to write more freely about all sorts of topics that just wouldn't make sense in the diary format I had. So I took the decision to make a second blog and started hunting around for inspiration for how it should look.

You don't have to spend too long on the IndieWeb before you come across [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/). I fell in love with his layout the moment I saw it. Black and white, free of clutter and optimised for reading.

I'm afraid I rather unashamedly copied it. I added a dark mode option, because I prefer that, but otherwise it's pretty much the same. I had the blog set up over the Easter weekend.

Since then, I've been writing every day, sometimes several times. The simple layout has also inspired me to just hit "new post" and start writing. The site is beginning to organise itself around how I think, almost by magic.

So, thank you Manu, for starting me on this journey. I hope you don't mind that I took your style, but I'm not taking the credit.
