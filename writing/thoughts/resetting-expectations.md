A few months back, I started to think a bit more intentionally about writing this blog. I wanted to improve the reader experience, by making [tweaks to the navigation](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/fine-tuning-post-display-in-wordpress/), and also by [scheduling posts](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/) in a more predictable way.

When I started writing here, I did so only to record my own thoughts. I had no idea that others would be reading. But when I started receiving emails, guestbook entries and RSS feed queries, I started to think of this site more as a publication than a notebook.

It's fun to be an editor as well as a writer. I had a backlog of content I could resurface. I was also part of the [blaugust](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/first-post-of-blaugust-2024/) challenge, so over the summer I was writing as often as possible. This continued into September, but all of a sudden, I'm looking at a pool of only three days of scheduled posts.

My first thought was to panic write something to fill a few days. But, that of course is daft, and completely at odds with my desire to [improve the reader experience](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-to-show-you-next/).

The editor part of my brain is bullying the writer part and that can only end in tears.

So there will not be a published post on 20 September 2024. I will deliberately break my streak of about 60 days of sequential publishing. But, after that, I will still stick to the pattern of publishing in the main feed at 6am each day UK time for the days I do post. And optionally, a post at 6pm if I want a second post. But no more than two.

And I'll continue to post [quick thoughts](/topic/quick-thoughts/) and other posts [not destined for the main feed](/topic/not-in-main-feed/).

This change will hopefully keep my editor and writer desires in better balance.
