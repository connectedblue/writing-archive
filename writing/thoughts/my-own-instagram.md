I've been posting photos to [my own version of instagram](https://diary.uncountable.uk/snapshots/) now for nearly two years and there's around 550 captioned photos so far.

At some point in the future, I'll figure out how to include the date also on the caption, but for now I just enjoy having my own photofeed to document things I see every week
