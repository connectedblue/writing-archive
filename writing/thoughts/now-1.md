The winter habitat season is coming to an end and we are transitioning slowly into spring. So, I'll be working on a variety of projects over the next few months of summer 2024:

- Wildflower surveys

- Tree resurvey along the canal

- Himalayan Balsam pulling

- Mulching trees

- Sowing seeds into grassland

- Harvesting seeds

- Start planning for the October Walking festival

- Organise summer green drinks sessions

- Summer term coding club after school in the library

- Environmental land management plan for the local town

- Plan and lead a Tree walk

- Weekly land management at Wild Acres

- New idea for the Artocalypse

Quite a list when you write it down. There's plenty of other admin type activities as well, so my calendar will be pretty full.

You can follow along in [my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) to see how I actually get on with this list
