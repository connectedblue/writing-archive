Matan talked about his writing style, and the times he is [top-down versus bottom up](https://matanabudy.com/top-down-writer-vs-bottom-up-writer/):

> When writing blog posts for this website, I usually have an idea for a post—usually a single line of insight or thought that I want to explore—and this is all I need to start writing. I put that line in the header and just start pouring everything out of my head. I don’t plan; I just write and eventually [just post it](https://matanabudy.com/should-i-post-this). This is bottom-up writing.
> 
> On the other hand, when I write longer pieces of text, such as university assignments, I always plan. I start with the structure, expanding each high-level description or headline into smaller pieces until I know what each section will contribute to the main text and what I will write in it (in a rough sketch). I start from the top.

For me, it's whether the piece is reactive or proactive. When I was making a lot of posts on LinkedIn, they were almost always reactive. Think of something, start typing and publish. The platform algorithm did the rest.

As bottom-up as you can get.

This post is also reactive, and therefore bottom up. I saw the post from Matan yesterday and made a mental note that I wanted to respond. But didn't get time until just now, when I had to think exactly what my response it.

More bottom up. Maybe there's a pattern forming here.

But not everything. I write a lot about [my experiences with money](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/) in this blog and they are always top down. Each topic is something that I have formulated a view on over the past couple of decades, and I take time to express it as completely as I can.

But the order I publish these posts is bottom up (or randomly, as some might observe). I didn't start writing in a storybook order. So this is why I am experimenting with something new this week: Republishing some previous posts [in an order that makes more sense to read](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/july-2024-principles-of-investing-week/). A top down approach to scheduling.
