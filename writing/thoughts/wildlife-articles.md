I'm lucky enough to [spend time with many great ecologists](https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/glorious-grasslands/) who provide invaluable knowledge about conservation and wildlife. I supplement that by reading good quality information from various sources.

I've put the latest links from those sites in the list below. I've not read them all ... that would be like drinking from a hose pipe. But I dip in when I can.

This list changes every day, so feel free to bookmark this page and return again in the future.

Enjoy discovering something new ...
