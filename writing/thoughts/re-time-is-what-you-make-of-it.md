Lou wrote a fascinating [insight into how he adjusted to life after work](https://louplummer.lol/time-is-what-you-make-of-it/). I suspect this happens quite often:

> During the couple of years that I tried to be retired, I had more free time than I'd ever had before. With no job to go to and a wife who was still heading to work each day, I had hours to do what I wanted, except I didn't know what I wanted. I read some books from the library, watched a few movies from my streaming queues, and went for walks on occasion. However, I lacked a sense of purpose. I ended up sleeping a lot, feeling sad and lonely. It was not a pleasant experience.

I stopped work five years ago and found that certain [benefits from work](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/) need to be replaced to help with the transition. Specifically: structure, purpose and identity were the things I worked on.

Reading through Lou's post, you can see how he went about this in a way that worked for him. The ability to [allocate time](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/) as you wish is such an amazing privilege and experience, but you can't really plan it in advance.

Sure, you may think you are going to travel, play golf, visit family or whatever. And if that's motivates you to save more and retire sooner, even better.

But be prepared for life to deal a different hand. There are so many opportunities out there that you are simply not aware of when your head is in work day to day.

My day to day activities are [logged in my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/). I truly never would have imagined any of them ten years ago.
