It's only been a few days, but I feel this blog is already forming into a shape that fits my mind.

Keeping a simple layout is forcing me to think carefully about how the content should be arranged. And it boils down to this:-

Each page should do one thing well.

There's a start and end to each page. No infinite scrolling. Navigation between pages will be links which I'll have to think carefully about.

So the blog as a whole should resemble a wiki as more pages are added .. cross referencing where necessary.

Almost every website starts with links to navigate the whole site. They are screaming "hey, here's a load of other stuff before you read this stuff".

I don't want to exhaust the reader. My navigation will be at the end, and they can choose to turn a page or not.
