I publish a post each day at 6am UK. Sometimes I also reply to posts written by others, and if I do, that will be published at 6pm.

The [best way to follow my blogs](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/id-rather-you-didnt-read-this/) is to subscribe via RSS. This is free, does not require your email address and can't be tracked.

Here are the URLs to enter into your RSS app depending on what you'd like to see:

  Feed of all articles:  
[https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/feed](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/feed)

  Feed of articles about money only:  
[https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/feed](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/feed)

  Feed from my diary:  
[https://diary.uncountable.uk/feed](https://diary.uncountable.uk/feed)

  Feed of Quick thoughts:  
[https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/feed](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/feed)

Pop these links into your feed reader and you're good to go.

If you don't know what a feed is, [check this site out](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to get started.
