If you're reading this in your RSS app, then you'll already know the awesome benefits of [owning your own scroll](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/own-your-scroll/). I want to start promoting this among other readers of my blog, and do my small bit to increase adoption.

I actually prefer if [you read my blog over RSS](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/id-rather-you-didnt-read-this/) than the web, for two reasons. Firstly, you have more chance of seeing my future posts that way, rather than remembering to visit the website again. But secondly, and more importantly, I think you will have an improved digital life if you incorporate RSS into your daily habits.

If you've never used RSS before, I think the easiest way to start is downloading an app on your phone, add a few feeds you like and try it for a few days, slowly adding more feeds.

However, this is still quite a leap for most people, so I have put together [a step by step guide](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/) for new people to get started. I include some starter feed URLs so you don't get bogged down in looking for something and then I direct people to [https://www.rsslookup.com/](https://www.rsslookup.com/) as a way to add your own feeds later.

This is where my request for your help comes in!

I have included detailed instructions for setting up an android app, because I am an android user. But I'd like similar instructions for iphone, and I don't have access to one.

Would you be able to write [a similar set of steps](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/) on how to do this that I can incorporate into my blog?

I am happy if anyone wants to take my article and copy/modify the text to include similar instructions on your own blog for your readers.

If we can collectively just get ten new people using RSS, then the world will be a little bit better place
