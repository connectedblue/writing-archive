I do reasonably often reply to posts by other writers. In fact it was while I was doing this that I stumbled on the [July Reply](https://birming.com/july-reply-blog/) challenge by Robert Birming.

I really like his suggestion of using Re: in the title. It's genius really - everyone instantly recognises a context when they see those three characters at the beginning of a subject line. It also avoids polluting my own url namespace - having all the slugs begin with `re-` means I can re-use those titles if I want to create a post of my own with a similar topic.

So, on this page for the month of July, I will list all my reply posts below as my contribution to the challenge.
