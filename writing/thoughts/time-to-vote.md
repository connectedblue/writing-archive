The UK is having a general election on Thursday 4 July 2024.

There are two things you need to take part. The first is to be on the electoral register before this date, which [you can do here](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote). The second is to have photo id on the day, which you can [find more information about here](https://www.gov.uk/how-to-vote/photo-id-youll-need).

If you haven't voted in an election before, but are eligible, please consider doing so this year. Collectively, we need to take responsibility for the future direction of this country.
