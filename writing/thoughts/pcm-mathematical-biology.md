Biology is a topic with conceptual hooks I can grasp, and relate them to the various areas of mathematics deployed in studying them.

The article started off with a very readable section on how cells work and some differential equations that can be used to model simple behaviour. But then it quickly develops a theme which is throughout the remainder of the text - biological processes and systems are enormously complicated and it's not clear about cause and effect. Furthermore, living cells are continuously changing which renders modelling almost impossible.

The section on genomics took on a different slant - more concerned with the combinations of four letter alphabets A, G, C and T which are bound in various ways in enornmous strands of DNA. This leads on to geometric and topological models used in molecular dynamics and protein folding.

One mind boggling example of the complexity of protein folding is to consider the double helix of DNA which is two metres long if stretched out end to end. Yet it zips itself into a nucleus in the middle of a cell that is 1/100th of a millimetre wide. Then, when the cell divides, it has to unzip itself so that the cell can replicate.

Physiology is the study of the co-operation and dynamics of all the systems in the human body. It involves fluid dynamics to model blood and air pressure to model breathing. Again, there are complex systems of partial differential equations, but with time delay.

Neurobiology, rather surprisingly, is rather short on theory and experimentation is hard to do. This book was written in 2008, so well before the recent explosions in AI, but reference is made to computer scientists being more interested in modelling devices rather than biological systems.

Population modelling and ecology invokes all the statistics needed to model spread of disease in large ecosystems. The SIRS model is referenced which became famous in COVID when everyone was obsessed with the R number. However the links between individual biological characteristics and their effect on macro population effects is really hard to get a grip on.

The biology of the animal is affected by the social behaviour in the ecosystem (again, a good recent example is slowing the spread of COVID through lockdown).

Evolutionary biology leans heavily on graph theory, and particular types of rooted, non cyclical graphs which can be used to model how individual characteristics may have evolved in previous generations.

Finally, the use of mathematics in medicine and public health is discussed, along with the woeful general ignorance in interpreting mathematical results correctly, especially as it applies in public policy.
