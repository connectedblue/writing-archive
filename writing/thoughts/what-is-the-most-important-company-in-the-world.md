Given the importance of [teaching sand to add up](/teaching-sand-to-add), it's quite remarkable how we pretty much devolved the task to just one company.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) fabricate 62% of the worlds chips. The next largest is Samsung with around 11%. But it's even more stark when you consider the advanced chips. TSMC have around 80% share of the 5nm technology and over 90% of 3nm.

A modern car may have as many as 3,000 chips inside it (which itself is mind boggling - does anyone really know what they all do?). So I think it's safe to say that TSMC is the most important company in the world.

But hang on ....

TSMC don't just magic chips out of thin air. They make them with machines. Those machines seem pretty important. Who makes those?

Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) are a Dutch company that make incredible machines that can etch computer logic onto molecules of sand. Who knew that the land of tulips and clogs would be producing such wizardry?

They have some competitors, but ASML produce 83% of the world's chip making machines. No-one even comes close, and they keep their know-how very close to their chest. So I think it's safe to say that ASML is the most important company in the world.

But hang on ...

Lithography means reflecting lasers off mirrors right? To target those molecules of sand precisely, you can't just use the wing mirror from your car. You need a really flat mirror. Who on earth makes those?

Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS) makes flat mirrors in Germany. Like really, really flat ones.

If you took a ZEISS mirror and scaled it up to be the size of Germany, the tallest peak on the surface would be 1mm. You could shine a laser onto a ZEISS mirror and target a golf ball on the moon.

Literally no-one else knows how to do that.

Without ZEISS, ASML would be hawking miniature windmills to tourists along the canals of Amsterdam.

So I think it's safe to say that ZEISS is the most important company in the world.
