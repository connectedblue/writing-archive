I'm have a celebration this week of blogging, conversation and connection.

At first glance, you might mistake blogging outside social media as a solitary activity. But then you notice the numerous blog carnivals, challenges and communities springing from every corner of the indieweb.

Most bloggers also use RSS to follow other people's blogs. You can quite comfortably follow 300 blogs, and all the latest posts will show up in a single feed. Reading other people's posts will sometimes inspire you to write your thoughts on the topic.

Which brings me to one particular style of posting I am celebrating this week: The Reply Post.

The concept is simple - you read a post from someone, and build on their ideas in a new post on your own site.

You can do this in any way you choose, but this is my preferred style of making reply posts:

- Start the title with `Re:` ... this was borrowed from Robert in his brilliant [July Reply Challenge](https://birming.com/july-reply-blog/). Everyone is used to the context of these three characters from email, so the reader immediately knows it's a reply post coming up.

- Mention the name of the author and link to their article in the first sentence. Again, this introduces the post context, and allows the reader to read the original first if they choose.

- Copy a small quote from the original post that inspired you the most and display it in a highlighted format that makes clear it's a quote from them and note your writing.

- Develop the reply below in whatever direction you want.

- Send an email, or make a comment on their blog to say you have made a reply post, and add some additional context.

I also log all my replies in [a dedicated reply section](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/reply-posts/) of my website. I don't always put replies into my main website and rss feed straight away. They are published for website readers to read if they navigate to that section.

So, this week I want to celebrate the reply post.

Over the next week, I will publish two posts a day which are replies I've made to other blog posts. It's a showcase of other blogger's work. A social way to develop ideas and share thoughts with each other.
