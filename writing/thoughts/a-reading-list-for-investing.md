If you are new to investing, you have a lot of information and new concepts to absorb. You can use my blog for some inspiration, but please remember I am not a financial advisor of any sort.

I write only from my own experiences, and I try to be as accurate as I can, although I can't recall or relate every twist and turn of my 25+ year journey.

That said, if you do want to see what I have to say, the following article order and grouping will make more sense than just reading in the order I wrote them.
