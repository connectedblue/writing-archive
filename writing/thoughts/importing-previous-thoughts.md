My first blog was created in 2012, and unfortunately lasted only six articles. It still exists on the free wordpress.com tier, so I took the opportunity this morning to [import them into this blog](/topic/first-blog/) so I can manage everything in one place going forward.

I wish I had kept it going from the start. I was interested to see that I wrote a post on my [sixty year strategy](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/sixty-year-plan/), which I have also recently [written about here](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-60-year-strategy/).

It was called Just My Thoughts Aloud, so a very similar idea to this blog. I did have the .com domain at one point, but let it lapse. The wordpress version can still be [viewed here](https://justmythoughtsaloud.wordpress.com/).
