Today I finally bit the bullet and finally created another blog to house all my non diary thoughts.

I've been keeping [an online diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) for about a year to record the things I do day to day. I've been very happy with that, and it's a nice way to share with the various groups I'm involved with.

But it's purpose is very clearly a diary. If I started putting random thoughts or musings on investing, it would quickly become un-navigable and unreadable.

So this blog is for all that. I probably won't put images here and keep the styling as simple as possible. New articles will get added when I feel like writing. But I want to get started on a few things burning through my mind:

- Lifestyle investing and financial independence

- Transitioning to retirement

- Indieweb

- Tech side projects

I'll create some categories to organise the posts to help readers find only the topics that interest them.
