Bit of a river themed week. Regular raft monitoring last Sunday, natural flood management with FWAG on Monday and water vole displacement on Wednesday.

Also did the regular Wild Acres day on Tuesday and the monthly Orchard party on Saturday. Popped into the council offices one evening for a committee meeting on the environmental land management plans for the town.

Spun up a new instance of FreshRSS to begin customising a new artocalypse service. Early days, but this is turning into an exciting IndieWeb project
