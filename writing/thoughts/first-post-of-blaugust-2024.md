It's 1 August and the start of the [Blaugust blogging challenge](https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/) which I have entered. My aim is to post something during every day in August.

The suggested first post this year is an introductory one, which is a great idea. I don't think I've ever done one of those before (apart from the About Me page I suppose).

My name is Chris and live in the Cotswolds, UK. I stopped work in 2019, aged 51, and I now spend my time on 5-6 nature recovery projects around the local area. I also have three community projects which I run: The local walking festival, a monthly green drinks session and the Code Club for 8-11 year olds in the library after school.

I have two blogs, this one for general writing and [my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) where I write up the various activities I get involved with.

My career lasted 29 years, mostly in the telecommunications and IT sector. Probably doesn't seem so long to most people, although to me it seemed quite long and varied. But I don't miss it at all. I'm now embarking on what I hope will be my second 29 year career dedicated to community and environment.

I don't really have a theme for writing - anything that comes into my head mostly. However, I do write a large number of articles on [how I manage money](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/), if that is your thing.

I follow a large number of blogs and quite like making reply posts. Next week, I'll be doing a week of just those posts to celebrate the work of other bloggers. One thing I'm looking forward to in Blaugust is to do this with some of the other bloggers taking part.
