watching the early commuters on the charles bridge at dawn, before going back to the hostel to sleep. was the thomas cook railway timetable really the only interesting thing to read. when you asked me for a map in german, i thought you meant ticket. you looked so free in the orange beetle, but i don't know why we camped on the pavement verge. running a laundrette seemed like the american dream, but what did you do before. i kept the nail cutters in a pouch for decades after. your letter was in the white box that opened with a key. we didn't mean to roll the cable wheel down the hill. i was as surprised as you to see the ashtrays and the towels, but luckily they didn't press charges. have a nice life really was the last thing you said.
