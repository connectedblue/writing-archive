It's often assumed that gaming is the gateway drug to becoming interested in technology, but Lou [confesses to not being a gamer](https://louplummer.lol/confessions-of-a-non-gamer/):

> I don't look down on gamers or gaming in any way. The networks engineers I work with, all of whom I respect for their giant brains, all play computer games. I've always been kind of jealous that this whole segment of society, the people who should be in my tribe for our love of technology, have a love and a passion for something that just totally mystifies me. I'm almost 60 and I know their are gamers older than me. I've seen some of them on YouTube. I just feel like that if the urge to play hasn't grabbed me by now that it never will. I miss not being able to talk to people about something so many find pleasure in, but it is what it is.

I'm in pretty much the same age bracket, having programmed my first computer in 1981 (a 1K sinclair zx81). From that moment on I was hooked. The process of creating a new program is what enthralled me, not using an application someone else had written (game or not).

Even then, there were games for the zx81 - it was a huge market and people acquired the computers solely for playing, not writing BASIC programs (let alone machine code. As an aside, my first ever computer book was [Mastering Machine code on your ZX81](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/2000236/Book/Mastering_Machine_Code_on_Your_ZX81_or_ZX80). It still sits on my shelf today).

The whole gaming thing mystifies me too. Very occasionally, someone will thrust a controller into my hands and I'll jerk the character until it spins upside down or gets killed. Of course, I admire the exponential growth in hardware and software techniques that brought us from the zx81 to playstation 5. I just can't motivate myself enough to participate.

I run an after school Code Club in the local library after school for the 8-11 year olds. My main objective is to get them to explore digital creativity and get the computer to do what's in their head rather than just passively using it. Of course, I have the constant battle to keep them off the javascript games sites. I count it as a major win if they create for 35 minutes before succumbing to the games.
