A brilliant and simple idea from [Robert (just another swede)](https://birming.com/junited-how-who/) to connect and share during the month of June.

I will update this post with a list of links that inspire and deserve to be shared.

- First up is [Apple Annie's retrospective of the WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/weblogpomo-2024-retrospective-communities-of-content). I didn't participate, but enjoyed the influx of posts from others into my RSS reader each day. I wholeheartedly agree that intimate connection through community is the joy of blogging.

- An intriguing [summer blogging competition](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-summer-2024-blog-post-competition) by Adam Mastroianni with prizes. I have an idea which I'm working on to enter.

- Juha-Matti wrote about [how it feels to read RSS feeds](https://hamatti.org/posts/what-does-it-feel-like-to-read-rss-feeds/) and I whole-heartedly agree. I have exactly the same experience and I just wonder quite what I did when I wasn't using an RSS reader.

- An interesting conversation between Charley Johnson and Tamara Kneese on the subject of [what happens online when we die](https://untangled.substack.com/p/what-happens-online-when-we-die). This is good background for my ongoing project to have [my writing being read in 200 years](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/) time.

- An alternative way to [live cheaply by choice](https://www.dhewi.co.uk/posts/living-cheaply-by-choice/) by my LinkedIn friend Daryl which I was happy to read in my RSS app first before I saw he also posted the onto LinkedIn.

- Rebecca Toh followed through on her dream idea and created a shared community library in Singapore called the [casual poet library](https://rebeccatoh.co/casual-poet-library/).

- Manu mused about [the money conundrum](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-money-conundrum), something which I have a lot of thoughts on. I made a [reply post here](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/the-money-conundrum/).

- Nathan gave a very [simple recipe for maintaining dotfiles](https://knowler.dev/blog/maintaining-dotfiles). I didn't know you could have a git repo without a checked out worktree. Nor have I ever issued git commands against a repo called something other than `.git`.
