Tom has a thoughtful push back on the [question of whether AI steals](https://endgameviable.com/post/2024/08/does-ai-steal/), which looks at the mechanics of what's actually going on in training process:

> It’s a misconception to say that AI steals, copies, or plagiarises. What AI does is _consume_, in roughly the same way that we do, by reading text, or looking at pictures, or listening to sounds.
> 
> It’s true that we have to trust OpenAI and the others when they say they’re not violating any licenses gathering their training data. We don’t have much choice. There’s _plenty_ of material out there for computers to gather freely, though.
> 
> It may or may not be infringing someone’s rights to consume a piece of art, be it writing, or a picture, or a song. It depends on what it is, and how it’s presented. But, _broadly speaking,_ if a human is allowed to view a piece of art, a computer probably is, too.

He goes on to acknowledge that machine consumption is on a scale much greater than humans (and maybe that's the thing that really bothers people).

But it's interesting to focus on the act itself - if a machine watches a film and produces a review, is that legally, or ethically, any different to me watching a film and writing a review? And if I sell that review to a publisher, perhaps many times over, do I owe the producers of the film anything?

You could argue that AI doesn't have a specific end goal in mind when it consumes. It digests the film in the training process, and only later it might be asked to do a review, give a plot summary, make a recommendation etc. But that's the same with me. I might go to every new film release, make notes and then only decide later to create new works from some notes.

I don't think any of this really matters in the long term. In 30 years time, we'll find it quite quaint that all we had to worry about was whether generated prompts were theft or not. In 2050, we'll be much more concerned over whether it's right that robots can murder humans.
