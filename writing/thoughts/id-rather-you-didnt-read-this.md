. . . on the web, at least.

Of course, you're very welcome to read my blog whenever and however you would like. But I'd prefer if you read my blog through an RSS app.

RSS is a pervasive, but little known, web technology that allows you aggregate all your content into one place for easy reading. There are very few websites without an RSS feed, although many don't advertise the link (or, even realise they have it).

When you put an RSS feed link into your RSS, it is called "subscribing". But don't worry - it's totally free, and you don't give your email address.

The main benefits to you of reading in RSS are:

- you can read your favourite sites ad free, with no algorithm. Even if you subscribe to 200 sites, you have a single feed in your RSS app with all the different sites interleaved in date order, latest content first.

- You don't have to visit the website again if you don't want. No cookie pop ups, slow page loads or confusing menus. But if you do want to take a look at the original site, it's always just a click away in the RSS app.

- You don't have to remember to visit websites. Sometimes an author may only make a post every six months. When they do, it'll pop into your feed.

- You are free of social media scroll. Everything in your feed is there because you want it to be. If you no longer find a website interesting, you can remove it from your feed with a click and you'll never see it again.

- You are a free citizen of the web if you use RSS. You control your own flow. You are no longer beholden to big tech platforms to have something interesting to read.

The main benefit to me of you reading this blog through RSS is you are likely to read more. I don't put my [site into search engines](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/not-on-google/), so however it was that you came across this post, there's a good chance you won't see it again.

You can find more information about RSS, and how to get the apps on [this excellent site](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

If you want to add my blog to your RSS app, you can find [the instructions here](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/rss-feed/).
