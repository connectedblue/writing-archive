Bel, the founder of Blaugust, made some important observations about [the nature of this blogging festival](https://aggronaut.com/2024/08/07/blaugust-and-large-language-models/) :

> We have one-hundred-seven participating blogs and fifty-nine of them are completely new to the Blaugust event. This means our community is growing, but also as it grows some of the collective cultural tenets of the community are changing a bit. Right or wrong this was an event born out of the MMORPG Blogging community, and most of us old-timers have created blogs where we ramble on about our thoughts regarding the games we are playing and the new games on the horizon that we find ourselves pining for.
> 
> I appreciate a fresh perspective as folks arrive who have been wholly disconnected from this original community. I think there has been a good deal of shared growth since we opened up the call to pretty much anyone who creates regularly syndicated content in whatever form that takes.

The bulk of the post discusses one particular topic about the use of AI in the event, but that has been well responded to by the community and I have nothing to add to what's been said.

However, the impact of widening of Blaugust participation on it's future survival is more interesting. I'm new to this in 2024, so have no idea what the historical context and culture has been around this event for the last decade. I'm also not a gamer, so could be considered an outsider who doesn't understand the core values.

My initial (and continued) observation is that this month long challenge is bigger than the sum of it's parts. The community on discord is welcoming and supportive and there has been an explosion of daily blogs released on all manner of subjects. I'm very much in favour of that because every single post is also taking a stand against the takeover of the web by big tech.

It's hardly surprising though. The gaming community collectively knows more than anyone else how to organise, engage, inspire and connect groups of people together toward a common goal.

They have (perhaps inadvertently) used those same techniques to draw in a wider crowd to what is fast becoming the Glastonbury of blogging. And just like the music festival, the original participants might grumble that "it isn't what it used to be".

All successful events need an inspiring leader, and Bel may be reluctant to become the Michael Eavis of blogging. It's a thankless task to organise and promote anything, but the moment it ceases to be fun for the organisers is when the event becomes imperilled.

There will need to be some discussion about how the event can grow in a sustainable way. I don't know all the organisational pinch points, so it's difficult to comment on the scalability of the current model.

One way it could expand is to borrow from the Glastonbury model and have several stages hosting different contributors, but connected by the overarching Blaugust brand. So a gaming stage, a tech stage, a writing stage etc, each run by a different person who co-ordinates activities in their area. Participants can then choose between one or more stage areas that they wish to take part in.

For example, I run the [Artocalypse Blog Carnival](https://the.artocalypse.org/upcoming-blog-carnivals/) and we could dedicate the August month to run a Blaugust art stage for artists. So maybe challenges, prompts etc related to blogging your art journey that month.

It seems to me that Blaugust is an important part of the IndieWeb community. If the current rate of growth continues, there could be 200+ blogs next year and more support will need to be in place to maintain the awesomeness.
