Although passive investing does not require decisions to be made about individual stocks, you definitely do need to decide which market indexes you want to track, and how much of your portfolio to allocate between them.

First of all, it is worth noting that if you truly want to invest in equities and not make any decisions at all, then investing in a global index tracker is an option. For example, the [FTSE GEIS Series](https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/indices/global-equity-index-series) is a range of indexes that covers every investable world market. If a fund tracks the FTSE All-World index, then you are passively tracking the average performance of 98% of everything.

I have not done this, primarily because I wasn't aware of easily purchased funds that could track these during most of my investing journey to date. But I did formulate a thesis for the indexes I tracked, which was reviewed periodically.

Overall, I have hardly made any strategic shifts at all, with the most major occurring in 2022. So, it's quite easy to summarise my approach in this post.

In 1999, I made my first conscious decision to invest passively in a market. The one I chose was the FTSE100, primarily because I thought that I'd most likely be in the UK when I retired, so I may as well peg my fortunes to that of the country. At the time, many of the constituents of the FTSE100 generated most of their earnings from the UK (including one I worked for at the time - Orange).

Over the next few years, that mix started to shift. By the mid 2000s, a lot of earnings came from overseas and I reviewed my strategy accordingly. However, I concluded that I was gaining some international exposure by continuing to put money in the FTSE100, so didn't feel the need to invest in other markets directly.

After the global financial crisis, stocks fell and the pound fell. Although the UK economy as a whole was stuck in a cycle of austerity and low growth, the FTSE100 was largely decoupled from this and around three quarters of the earnings were pegged to the dollar rather than the pound.

Again, when I would periodically review the investment strategy, I concluded that FTSE100 was giving me both international diversity and currency protection. So I carried on with the same approach.

It was only towards the late 2010s that I started to become more uncomfortable with a 100% FTSE100 strategy. This was also the period I stopped working, so it brought into sharp focus that my assets needed to last another 50 years without me making new contributions.

I saw a structural problem. The FTSE100 is primarily utility-type companies - banks, insurance, construction, communications etc. This is great as a solid earning source - none of those things are going away. But, on the other hand, London is not the home to capital any more. That status was lost a long time ago.

New listings and innovations are happening in the US. So I decided finally in 2022 to move 40% of my portfolio from UK to S&P500. Furthermore, since I am in drawdown, I will be doing so from the UK side, which will increase that percentage over time.

In general, strategies should stay consistent and rational, but subject to regular review as fit for purpose. I made one major shift in 23 years, which might be considered too conservative.

It's early days, but in the two years since then, it's bedded in nicely and I feel much better aligned for the decades ahead.
