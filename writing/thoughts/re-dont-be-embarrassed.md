Grubz is [no longer embarrassed](https://grubz.blog/dont-be-embarrassed/) about how he dresses, despite it being similar to how his dad used to look:

> For a while it felt weird stopping by the gas station or grocery store looking like a 1980's used car salesman but next thing I know I've just been going through the motions for the last two years and now I don't really think about it. When I do, I'm like eh, at least I look like I have my shit together so who cares.
> 
> Then everyone in the parking lot sees me get into my beat up, 10 year old Honda and that kinda cancels out the little strip of wood around the heel but that's ok!
> 
> In 20 minutes I won't even remember half of the things I did today, let alone my assumptions about what the random strangers at Kroger might of thought about me. A year from now? 10 years? I don't even remember a single specific thing I did for the entire year of 2014.

A good way to quickly test what other people think of your look, is to assess what your views are on how the people in your immediate vicinity are dressed. Chances are you don't actually give a monkeys what anyone else is wearing.

So guess what, they haven't given you one thought either. You're just wallpaper on the backdrop of life. Although not being seen at all might be more painful than being seen and judged.

The transition from pink studded belts with large tongued skating shoes to long sleeved shirts with fake wood shoes is a rite of passage we all share. Not because we don't care, but because we realise it takes more than your wardrobe to make an impact on the world.
