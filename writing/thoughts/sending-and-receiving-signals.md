Communication between people is, in essence, the sending and receiving of signals to satisfy a human desire.

The richness of signal is entirely dependent on the medium of communication. An asynchronous exchange of letters has a very different style to a telephone conversation or text. The medium may also impact the content of the signal - there are things you might say over the phone that you would not over text (and vice-versa).

Social media created a variety of bilateral signals that amplify these effects. If I read your post in my feed, an anonymous signal is sent to add one to your view count. If I press the like button, I'm sending you a stronger signal that identifies me to you. If I comment, then we have a deeper exchange of signals.

In turn, this can impact the style of content you send over the medium. If you want views, likes and comments, you will write in a different way than if you had no feedback from the readers.

I try to avoid this by using two different mediums to receive and send signals to the public internet.

I send signals primarily by writing posts on my blogs. I have no idea who reads what (although I have a rough idea of daily overall visitor numbers from rudimentary traffic stats on my host).

Conversely, I receive signals from 600+ sources via my RSS reader. None of those authors know either that I'm subscribed, or whether I read a particular piece of content. There is no acknowledgement signal from my reader back to the site.

Yet, despite this deliberate separation of concerns, I feel very much part of a networked community. I stumble upon posts that contain links to posts I have made in the past. And I also make reply posts to topics others have raised. And I'm gaining inspiration from every interaction I have, whether in public or private.

Social media is definitely not the only way to exchange meaningful messages - the internet itself is built on reliably connecting signals between senders and recipients.

Explore those other ways and you may just find a better way of digital life.
