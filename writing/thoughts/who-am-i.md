Nice to meet you, and thank you for scanning!

My name is Chris Shaw. I'm a technologist and conservationist living in the Cotswolds. This page gives more details about the projects I'm involved with and how you can reach me.

### Read Me

I keep a [daily diary here](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) and a [more general blog here](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/).

The things I write most about are [wildflowers](https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/glorious-grasslands/), [money](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/) and [digital living](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/digital-life/).

### Contact Me

I welcome email on [chris@uncountable.uk](mailto:chris@uncountable.uk). My number is on the card - text or WhatsApp works best. I keep my phone on silent so I'll never hear it ring if you call.
