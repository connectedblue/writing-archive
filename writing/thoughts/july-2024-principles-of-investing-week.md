I often write about money and my financial journey, but it may not always make sense, especially for those new to investing.

So starting tomorrow, 22 July, I will publish a daily article from Monday to Friday on some of the principles I have formulated over the years. The topics I will cover are:

- **Mon:** Why accumulate wealth?

- **Tue:** What is Financial Independence?

- **Wed:** Most important factors for accumulating wealth

- **Thu:** Saving vs Investing

- **Fri:** What is risk?

I hope you enjoy this journey through some investing ideas, and it inspires you to consider the principles you like to follow when making long term financial decisions.

I may do future weeks covering other money topics if there is demand. Drop me an email to [chris@uncountable.uk](mailto:chris@uncountable.uk) if you have feedback.
