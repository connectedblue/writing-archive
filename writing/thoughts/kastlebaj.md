```
walking in the open meadow
mallow creeping through the knapweed
knowing summer sun is fading fast
flowers need to turn seed
sowing life one more time
together with the spinning earth
embeds water soil and light
lifting leaves towards the rays
rain glistens across open pores
pollen puffs like yellow ice
insects feasting in morning dew
darkness falls and moths appear
anchored always in one home
harvesting sunlight for essential nutrient
not always something to welcome 
```
