Since stopping work in 2019, mornings for me have become a very welcome ritual which I have not tired of.

Before talking about the current ritual, it's worth recapping on the morning rituals of the previous 29 years, which will be familiar to most readers. Weekdays consisted of waking to an alarm, getting showered and dressed, quick breakfast and out the house in 30-45mins. I neither despised nor loved them - they were simply a necessary gateway to traverse.

Weekends were different of course, the main difference being waking without an alarm, although I would still rise early. The period of time between waking and going out would vary.

Since 2019 however, I am free [to allocate time](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/) as I choose. I have a pretty active life which is [documented in my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk), but a morning ritual has been created which is constant throughout, regardless of what's going on that day.

I wake early, usually around 6am give or take, and the key feature is no alarm. I get up straight away and head to the kitchen to put the kettle on. If I'm eating lunch out that day, I'll put on eggs to boil.

The next task without fail for the last couple of years has been to complete three puzzles: Wordle, Quordle and Waffle. My aim is different in each. Wordle to get a higher percentage of 2s and 3s than 5s and 6s; Quordle to finish in 7 annd Waffle to maintain my unbroken run (currently 220).

It doesn't take too long to complete the puzzles, then I check my RSS - blogs first then news or politics. Breakfast is porridge during weekdays and toast with marmite at weekends.

I make lunch, get dressed and head out usually around 8.30.

The reason this works for me is every day starts the same, no matter the content. Being in control of schedule is a privilege most people don't have, so I enjoy it immensely.
