I can now post quick thoughts to the [Quick Thoughts](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/) section of my blog and they won't appear on the front page or the main RSS feed.

So no-one alse is disturbed by these random things.

But if you do happen to want to see them, you can visit [the page](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts) or subscribe to them via RSS using the url [https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/feed](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/feed)
