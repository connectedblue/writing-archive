While browsing the Blaugust feed, I noticed a post from JJxsly on [the Princeton Companion to Mathematics](https://jjxsly.bearblog.dev/princeton-companion-to-math-draft-outline-of-main-branches/):

> [PCMMainBranchOutline](https://tinyurl.com/PCMMainBranchOutline) is pulled from the Princeton Companion to Mathematics[1](https://jjxsly.bearblog.dev/princeton-companion-to-math-draft-outline-of-main-branches/#fn-1) and is a brief mind map of the main branches of the subject that the author(s) deemed important. Even though I am just starting to get into it, the PCM seems like an awesome book to return to periodically for someone interested in math.

This book is exactly the kind of book I crave. Before going to university in 1987, I acquired a copy of [The Mathematical Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Experience) which I devoured.

I'm really just an interested amateur, but from the book description, I think I'm going to be similarly gorging on this, although it will probably take me a lot longer to digest the complexities of the articles.

Well worth Â£65 from Amazon
