Bonds are a popular investment asset class, and you often hear generic advice along the lines of "holding bonds de-risks your portfolio". It seems to be a universal axiom that you have a low percentage of bonds when you are young, and a high percentage when you are old.

Content warning: I don't invest in bonds, so you should treat everything that follows as uninformed opinion, not my lived experience.

Bonds are loans to companies and governments. On issue, you lend an amount of capital and receive a coupon payment in return (this could be annual, quarterly or whatever is agreed in the terms of the bond issue). Most bonds have a fixed redemption date when the original amount of capital is returned and no more coupons are received. There are also undated bonds.

If you buy a bond on issue, and hold it to redemption, you know exactly what your cashflows are (assuming the bond issuer does not default, in which case you receive nothing). There are credit agencies who rate bond issuing entities on a scale from AAA to junk which is supposed to give you an idea of how likely they are to default.

The thing that makes bonds interesting is that you don't have to hold them to redemption. You can sell those future cash flows to someone else in the bond market for a value which is determined by demand and supply of those bonds.

Market prices of bonds (especially AAA government bonds) are very tightly linked to interest rates. Rises and falls in those central bank rates cause demand to fluctate. In addition, central banks can buy or sell bonds to control the supply (also known as quantitative easing). This feeds through to market price also.

It may be that I've misunderstood how bonds work (highly likely), but all of this means that I literally have no idea how to put togther an investment strategy for bonds that will [beat inflation over the long term](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/setting-investment-objectives/).

And the first rule of investing is that if you don't understand something, you shouldn't invest in it. I have done a lot of work to try and understand bonds, but they elude me . I do have a pretty good understanding of [why I want to invest in shares](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-i-invest-in-stocks/), and I'm not really comfortable moving into another asset class until I have that core understanding.

The one area where I can see a benefit is predictability if you hold them to redemption. I can sort of see a cash flow strategy where you arrange for layers of bonds to mature at different dates and create a cash flow. Maybe if I reach my mid 80s, that might be an option. But it sounds a bit too much like hard work and I can't really see the 80 year old Chris wanting to do it.

I plan cash flow using a simple [4 year reserve rule](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/layering-your-cash-accounts/) so I don't feel I need the complexity that bonds would entail.

The other oft cited reason to hold bonds is to reduce risk. My [approach to risk](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-risk/) is very much top down, and I would need to frame holding bonds against the top level risk of not being able to put your hands on cash at every point in the future.

I'm very open to hearing your views though. Are you able to explain how investing in bonds would enhance my investment portfolio and suggest a strategy I could follow? Let me know on [chris@uncountable.uk](mailto:chris@uncountable.uk).
