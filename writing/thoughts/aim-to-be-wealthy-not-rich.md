Like it or not, most of us dedicate a fair chunk of time to the acquisition of money, which we then use to support our lifestyle. There's also a strong belief that if we acquire more money, we can have a better lifestyle.

A natural consequence is we perceive some people have more money than us, and some have less. This perception is entirely driven by observation - we rarely, if ever, have access to the financial records of others.

These observations might be their house, car, clothes, holidays, spending habits and so on. Or we might observe their job and conclude something about their income. A car mechanic might assume that they have less money than a lawyer.

After concluding that someone has more money than us, we assign them the label "rich". There is a relative spectrum of richness - you will never be able to earn enough to be as rich as Jeff Bezos, but you probably could be as rich as your mate.

Being rich on the back of observations of earned income and spending is a precarious, transient position. Would you still be as rich if your earnings halved? Are you still rich if your spending is greater than your income and the difference fueled by debt?

Is a lawyer who takes home £60,000 and spends £55,000 richer than a car mechanic who takes home £30,000 and spends £20,000?

Over the long term, a more resilient position is to [build wealth](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-accumulate-wealth/) and increase your net worth. The principal reason for doing so is that your investment assets can then [generate cash flow](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/saving-versus-investing/) to support your lifestyle, rather than needing to exchange your labour for money.

As a very broad rule of thumb, someone in their late 50s in the UK might need a net worth of 20 times their annual lifestyle spend to be [financially independent](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/).

So, using the hypothetical examples above, the lawyer would need around £1.1m, while the mechanic would need £400k. Furthermore, the lawyer is going to find it impossible to get there with only £5,000 to invest every year, whereas the mechanic should get there after 25-30 years or so.

In fact the lawyer would struggle to accumulate even the mechanic's lifestyle after 30 years.

The important takeaway from all this is not the numbers, but the principle of wealth building. It's rarely about displays of income or spending levels. Instead, you can get there with [a few consistent behaviours](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/) over a long period.

A get rich slow scheme.
