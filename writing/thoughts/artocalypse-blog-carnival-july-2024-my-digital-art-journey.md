I'm so excited to be hosting the very first [Artocalypse Blog Carnival](https://the.artocalypse.org/upcoming-blog-carnivals/), to be held during July 2024.

This is part of a series of launch events for the [Artocalypse](https://artocalypse.org/), a new community platform for IndieWeb Artists which uses the power of RSS to showcase their work.

I'm a co-founder of the Artocalypse, along with [Kimberly](https://iamkimberly.org/). I do the tech stuff while she handles the artistic and expo sides.

So, what better topic for our first carnival than

**My Digital Art Journey**

There are a myriad of different art forms: visual, writing, performing, sculpting, musical and so on. The digital tools available now provide a variety of different ways to express, publish or sell your art.

What was your journey?

How do you present yourself and your art to the world?

I really can't wait to read your entries. Especially from those who probably don't consider themselves artists like bloggers, coders, cooks, gardeners and the like. Everyone and anyone who has a touch of artistry to their creativity.

### How to enter

_This carnival has now closed and you can read the [roundup post](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/round-up-artocalypse-blog-carnival-july-2024) here_. _You can see [the upcoming Artocalypse Blog Carnivals](https://the.artocalypse.org/upcoming-blog-carnivals/) here_

- Open to anyone. Post in any language you like (preferably one on google translate so I can read it!)

- Write the post on your own website that can be read without logging in (so not social media or paywall sites).
    - If you don't have a website, write an article in google docs, set the sharing permission to "Anyone with the link can view" and submit that!

- Include a link to this post at either the beginning or the end and state this is your entry for the July 2024 Artocalypse Blog Carnival.

- Send me the post link to [chris@uncountable.uk](mailto:chris@uncountable.uk) any time between now and 31 July.

- I will then do a roundup post in early August with a short write up of all the entries and links back to your posts.

- The Artocalypse will be promoting the roundup post on its website and social media channels.
