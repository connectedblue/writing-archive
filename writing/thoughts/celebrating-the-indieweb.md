The [May IndieWeb Blog Carnival](https://hamatti.org/posts/indieweb-carnival-may-round-up-post-creative-environments/) hosted by Juha-Matti Santala has just come to an end. He did a terrific job of hosting - a great topic and fabulous roundup of all the entries.

Reading the articles also gives me a chance to update my RSS reader with more authors I want to follow.

I didn't have the stamina to take part in the [WeblogPomo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024), which involved blogging every day during May. But a lot of people in my feed did and it was great to see them pop up daily.

If you want to take part in the June Blog carnival, head over to [Andrei's host page](https://andrei.xyz/post/indieweb-carnival-june-2024-diy-something-from-nothing/) where the topic is "DIY - Something from (Almost) Nothing". It's free to enter and a great way to feel part of the blogging community.
