In response to my post about [wanting to be read in 200 years](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/), my friend [Gerard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardmclean/) responded on LinkedIn, which I can't link to, so here's the quote

> If you want to do the heavy lifting, tips are freeâ€¦ if you want us to lift, [Sharktooth Press](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sharktooth-press/) is my imprint that will charge you massive amounts of cash for a legacy ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Seriously, though, thatâ€™s really the whole market for the imprintâ€¦ legacy.

Text files and the medium they are stored onâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got SyQuest cartridges, CD-ROMs, ZIP Drivesâ€¦ 5.25 floppiesâ€¦ none of that is really readable anymore so I keep shifting to the latest mediumâ€¦ these days itâ€™s a set of 2T flash drives, redundant storage because â€¦ failureâ€¦ paper burns though, so even books arenâ€™t safeâ€¦

I created this post to so I can remember what he said. Already I have two pieces of knowledge - there are companies out there who will help on this journey. And secondly, a really interesting book recommendation.

But, more than that, this blog can act as a record of how I go about this archiving project.

So I'm [creating a tag](/topic/future-archive/) so to keep all the related information together. I'm feeling motivated to start and see where it takes me.

This post is the official start of the journey toward a solution ...
