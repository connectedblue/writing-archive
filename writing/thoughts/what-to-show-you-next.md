Like most people with a personal website, this exists only for my own amusement. I put whatever I want in here, whenever I want.

But I also know I have readers too. Some I know in real life, some online and some I've never interacted with. Some visit the homepage directly and others read through RSS.

On most blogs, the default display on the main home and RSS feed is "here is the last thing I wrote". Over the last few months, I've been re-orienting mine to mean "here's what I want to show you next".

In other words, the home page is just a simple way for me to unfold an ongoing story to you.

So I choose one article a day and schedule it in advance. At the time of writing, I have a week and a half of posts lined up, one per day. This means that time spent updating my website is in in two parts: one is just me in purely writing mode, and the other is me as an editor, trying to sequence content in a suitable order for readers.

There are other parts of my site which are of interest only to me, so that's where I stick other stuff instead of cluttering my home page. For example, you probably don't want to read about my [quick thoughts](/topic/quick-thoughts/) or my [ongoing reading project](/thoughts-on/princeton-companion-to-mathematics/). And soon I will be importing the 700+ posts I made to LinkedIn between 2018 and 2022. These are all part of my ongoing attempt to be [read in 200 years](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/) time, but of little value to anyone else.

One consequence of the "here's what I want to show you next" approach is that I may republish something you have seen before, either on other parts of the site you stumbled into, or even the home page.

A bit like repeats on TV (which everyone seems to complain about). But I prefer to think of it more as replaying a greatest hits album.

I like rereading my old posts, and if I come across one I thought was good, I'll stick in in the schedule as something I want to show you next.
