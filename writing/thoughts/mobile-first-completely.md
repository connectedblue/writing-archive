You often hear people talk about "mobile first" design, and there are endless opinions about what it means. Yet I rarely hear about the `**@media** **only** screen **and** (orientation: landscape)` CSS selector that applies when you tilt your phone to landscape.

Video applications like YouTube and Netflix have this instinctively built in as a way to view the movie full screen. But most applications look pretty terrible if you accidentally tip the phone.

But it could be a whole new interface option for users. The unifying messaging app Beeper utilises this mode pretty nicely.
