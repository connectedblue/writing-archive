Once you have an [investing strategy](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-60-year-strategy/), you will want to set some more specific objectives for your portfolio that you can track as part of your [future modelling and planning](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/).

I've come across lots of people whose objective is something along the lines of "if it goes up, I'm happy". While this is simple to track in the short term, it may not lead to the best financial outcomes over the long term.

To measure the effectiveness of your investing strategy, it's best to have an independent benchmark that you can easily compare performance against. Ideally, this benchmark should never change over long periods and that allows you to assess accurately aggregate performance over multiple years.

There are two different benchmarks you can base from, depending on whether you are following an active or passive investment strategy.

### Passive investing benchmark

Passive investing is allocating your capital [in one or more whole markets](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/choosing-a-passive-strategy/) and accepting the [guaranteed market return](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/) from those markets.

You still have some broad decisions to make and benchmark. For example, which markets to invest in, and how much of your portfolio goes in each.

The best way to benchmark your actual portfolio performance is to compare it with RPI plus a bit over the same period. How much is "a bit"? Well, it can be whatever you want, but that same offset should also be used in your [planning spreadsheets](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/) to ensure you don't run out of money in the long term.

I use RPI plus 2%pa. This is fairly conservative - most major markets have performed better that this over rolling ten and twenty year time periods. When I last checked my benchmark over the 26 years from 1998 to 2024, the average portfolio performance was around RPI plus 3.1%. Doesn't sound like much, but that's 50% more!

But I still use +2% in my forward planning because I have no evidence that the next 25 years is going to perform the same as the last twenty five.

One trap to avoid with the RPI benchmark is comparing over too short a time period. There was a significant bout of inflation in the UK over 2022 and 2023, and it takes a while for this to feed into company earnings and hence share prices.

So use the measure over at least a rolling 5 year period and preferably longer.

### Active investing benchmark

**Content warning**: What follows is merely an opinion, not my own journey. I am not an active investor, so I have never needed to use this benchmark.

If you are an active investor, then you are trying to beat the market over long periods. No-one sets out intentionally to under perform the market, although you are at risk of that by following an active strategy. This is why it's important to have a benchmark so you can constantly monitor and adjust if it's not meeting your expectation.

The benchmark to use is the change in unit price of an appropriate index tracker fund with dividend accumulation over the time period you are measuring.

You might wonder why this is the case, rather than just using the published market index values:

- actual unit prices are after fees (usually 0.1-0.2%pa) so they like-for-like with your portfolio valuation which is also net of fees.

- Published indexes do not include dividend distribution, so you will be missing out a chunk of total return otherwise. Again, this compares like for like with your portfolio which also includes dividends received.

It's also worth considering what an "appropriate index tracker fund" is.

It depends on the areas where you are focussing on in your active strategy. For example, if your research leads you to invest in the UK, US and Japan, there's little point in using the Venezuelan Index tracker.

Ideally, you would use the measure each market segment against a market index fund for that same market, e.g. the L&G 100 Index Acc for the UK market.

Or, to keep things simple, you could just use the Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRL) and just compare your strategy to the "do nothing" approach in investing in the whole of the world.

### A note on cash outflows and inflows

Measuring your portfolio performance against a benchmark is vital to inform your future decisions and financial well being, but it doesn't have to be a super micro calculated number. Always remember that your portfolio value is your portfolio value.

But, when benchmarking, you do need to broadly adjust for cash inflows and outflows during a period. You can't just take fund value five years ago with fund value today, unless you haven't actually added or withdrawn from that pot during that time.

You could try and do a precise calculation of additions and withdrawals against the benchmark, but you rarely have the data to do that. Instead, I just calculate the total additions and withdrawals and add the difference to the starting fund value (i.e. starting fund value plus contributions over the period minus withdrawals over the period).

That won't be mathematically precise, but it will give you a good enough ball park to see how the underlying performance of your actual portfolio compares to your chosen benchmark.
