Vixiss writes about [social media addition](https://vixiss.bearblog.dev/on-social-media-addiction/) and three common reasons to put off trying to tackle it:

> Since quitting traditional social media altogether, I have regained so much time in my day where I can spend on other meaningful endeavours like working on my career, learning a new language, or even starting a blog! Where I used to spend hours in a day just aimlessly scrolling and remembering none of it even five minutes later, I was now granted with an extra hour or two a day to actually spend my time on things that make for a more fulfilling life.

He uses a word which can be applied to many aspects of life: intentional. Be very specific about the purpose you are undertaking an activity. I often use it when [talking about money](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/), but it equally applies to social media usage.

Starting a blog is an excellent way to deal with this because there's an amount of upfront friction to overcome ... what does the blog look like, how will I organise it, what will I write about etc. All these things are provided in a simple framework on social media so you don't have to think.

Once you are intentional about your digital life, the outcomes will be more rewarding. I left LinkedIn about two years ago (the only social media I've participated in on a regular basis) and started blogging a year or so ago.

For me, [receiving an email](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/contact-me/), comment or [guestbook entry](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guest-book/) from someone who has read my blog is worth a thousand views/likes on social media.

And occasionally, in my RSS reader, I'll stumble across someone who has linked to a post of mine from their blog. That is incredibly uplifting, because you realise that we are not all typing into a lonely void. There is a community out there having a global conversation in a considered and welcoming way.

Try getting that from your social media feed.
