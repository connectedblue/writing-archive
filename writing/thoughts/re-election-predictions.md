A few days before the 2024 UK general election, I wrote [a prediction post](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/election-predictions/) for some fun, so this post reviews how I got on.

They were organised into ten areas:

- Labour majority will be between 110 and 150.
    - It ended up at 172. At the upper end of predictions, and less than Tony Blair in 1997. Clearly a landslide, but 600,000 less people voted Labour than in 2019, and over 1m less than 2017.

- Conservatives will get less than 100 seats.
    - They got 121. Lowest ever I think.

- Lib Dems will get 60-80 seats.
    - 72\. Bang in the middle of the range.

- Greens will win 3.
    - Yay! They got 4.

- SNP will get 20 to 30 seats.
    - Collapsed to 9. This was the big shock of the night and contributed to a Labour win in Scotland.

- Nigel Farage will win Clacton.
    - Yes. He did.

- Turnout will be 67-69%.
    - It was 60%. Surprisingly low given the opportunity for change. I don't know who stayed away. Tories probably.

- Rishi Sunak will resign on Friday, having lost his seat.
    - He did resign sort of. He will stay on for a bit. He didn't lose his sit but he probably wishes he had so he could just go. Bonus prediction: He'll resign his seat before the end of 2024.

- Biggest post election talking point will be the imbalance of FPTP, with the focus being liberals on a lower vote share than Reform but with 10x the seats.
    - I think I'll take this as a win. The focus has been on Labour landslide with only 1% increase of vote share. But lib dems did get lower vote share than reform with 15x the seats. We won't get PR before the next election, but I think we're on a path that ends there.

- Keir Starmer will create two new departments, one for Energy and Environment and the other for Business Growth.
    - He didn't create any new departments, but did do two surprise appointments of Ministers in Patrick Vallence and James Timson

So four in ten of the predictions came in. I don't think I'm going to be the next John Curtice, but I'm very happy with the result as a whole.
