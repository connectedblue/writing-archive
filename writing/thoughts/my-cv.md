This is a record of my first career from September 1990 to August 2019.

Twenty nine years probably seems quite short to most, although I felt it quite long and varied. Since I want to spend my fifties [allocating time how I choose](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/), it simply wasn't realistic to have a standard 40 year career. Instead, I see [my current activities](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) as my second thirty year career (since I hope to still be doing at least some of these things into my eighties).  
  
At this point, this post is for historical context only. I very much hope to never need to compile a CV in the future. When I complete [my annual reflections](https://diary.uncountable.uk/tag/annual-reflection/) in my diary, this post will make a useful cross reference.

This was also my LinkedIn profile, but since I have decided to mostly freeze that account going forward, this post should be considered the authoritative source from now on.
