When I add a new RSS feed to my reader, it automatically pulls in all the posts from the new source and places them at the top, regardless of date order. This particularly screws up [my blogroll](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/blog-roll/)

So now I leave them in the "uncategorised" folder for a few days and then move them into the blog folder so new posts come in order with everything else.
