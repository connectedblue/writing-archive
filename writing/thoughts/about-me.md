Welcome to my blog!

My name is Chris and currently live in the Cotswolds. I [stopped work](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/stopping-work/) back in 2019, aged 51, and restructured my lifestyle since then around 5 or 6 nature recovery projects across my local area.

My main passions are conservation, computer science and [lifestyle investing](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-accumulate-wealth/). I also enjoy walking and networking across the local community.

This blog is where I share my thoughts on various topics which interest me. I welcome conversations on these. So [ask me stuff](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/ask-me-stuff/), if you wish.

I also have [this diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) to track my day to day activities.

I am a member of [The Artocalypse](https://artocalypse.org/), a community of IndieWeb artists which I co-founded.
