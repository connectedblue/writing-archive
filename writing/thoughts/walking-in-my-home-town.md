I left the town I grew up in after school in 1987. I still return regularly return because the parental home is there, but it's on the outskirts so I'm generally in and out without paying too much attention.

Today I had an hour free after getting some groceries, so I took the opportunity to walk around and see what had changed. I walked slowly to try and remember what was in each part during the 80's when that was the place I knew best.

The basic layout and buildings haven't really changed, but plenty of details have. The old library is now a wellness centre, but stands out in it's historic plot surrounded by modern buildings. The old car park behind Boots is now a paved square with a whole host of new facilities.

The indoor market, which also had an outdoor component is now impossible to locate. As is King's shade walk which was a tiny closed off square of shops accessible through an alleyway.

I briefly scanned the faces to see if by chance I might bump into someone I know. But even if I did pass someone, time will have painted over signs of recognition.

I don't feel a strong affinity or attachment to the town. It's one of several hundred identikit places that circle London. I'm glad I live where I do now.

I am in a WhatsApp group with school friends though, which is my link to the past. Having shared experiences and memories is a much more powerful draw than a bunch of buildings that morph over time.

The WhatsApp chat is pretty much like it would be in the Barley Mow except we are spread all over the world. I think we all prefer it that way.
