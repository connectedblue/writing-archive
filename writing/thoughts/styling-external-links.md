Sometime ago, I borrowed from [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/) the idea of styling external links differently . The north east arrow like this appears on all links that are not internal to my `uncountable.uk` domain.

I think this helps because I like to cross link a lot to my other posts, so this gives a nice visual clue between internal and external references. This also includes links to [my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) which is on a different subdomain, but still render as internal links.

I made a recent tweak to this interface to include a purple "visited" colour on external links. This is a common pattern on search engines, although I've not seen it so much on blogs. But, it's another service to the reader to give them a clue as to whether they have visited that external link before or not.

To see it in action, click on the link to Tracy's site above and come back here - should now be purple (of course, if you have been to her site before, it would already have been purple). Although if you do click through, you're unlikely to return here - Tracy's site is an awesome read and easy to get lost in for hours.

When I set up this blog, one of the first posts I wrote was [a design statement](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/design-thoughts/) on how I wanted this website to appear to the world. That was actually very helpful in shaping the look, but also not just adding random stuff for the sake of it.

I think this change to links is in spirit of that initial statement. But I have also developed deeper thoughts for [the purpose of the main home page and rss feed](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/), so perhaps now is a good time to update that design statement.

If you want to see the code for the external link styling, go ahead and open the developer tools on this post and take a look!
