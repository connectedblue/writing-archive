Summer 2024 is in full swing, with seed harvesting, balsam pulling and monitoring and surveying. I'm planning my autumn and winter schedule now and there's quite a few projects lined up:

- Summer code clubs in the library where the theme is building a sports website

- Lead a course on wordpress for some 16-24 year olds who are not in employment, education or training.

- Complete the October Walking festival website and open up for bookings

- Organise autumn and winter green drinks sessions

- Small mammal river monitoring

- Sowing seed to restore meadows

- Riverfly monitoring on two established sites

- Autumn term coding club after school in the library

- Environmental land management plan for the local town

- Annual walking festival in October

- Weekly land management at Wild Acres

- Winter habitat management with Glorious Grasslands

- Developing expo feature for the Artocalypse

- Reading challenge on the Princeton Companion to Mathematics

Quite a list when you write it down. There's plenty of other admin type activities as well, so my calendar will be pretty full.

You can follow along in [my diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) to see how I actually get on with this list
