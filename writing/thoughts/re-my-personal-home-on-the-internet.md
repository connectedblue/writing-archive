It's always good to see a new personal website come online and Dominik [announced his](https://dominikhofer.me/personal-internet-home) last month. Although he thinks he's late to the game, he's incredibly early. Most of his peers do not have a personal website. And yes, I do believe the 40yo Dominik in 2041 will indeed be grateful you gifted him this.

I, on the other hand, am rather late to the game. I first programmed a computer in 1981 and got immediately hooked. So when the WWW emerged in the 90s, it didn't take long to figure out what the pages were made out of.

I had a brief blogging experience in 2012 (a grand total of six posts which have been transferred here for completeness. But I didn't start [my online diary](https://diary.uncountable.uk/) until 2023. Although I enjoy keeping that up to date with all the activities I do, it's rather constrained in format by definition and design. So, finally in 2024 I created this blog to record my thoughts.

I like the design of Dominik's site, both from a navigation and content perspective. There's already a lot of stuff in there, but you can see how the structure will bend and evolve over time to suit his lifestyle.

I wholeheartedly agree that everyone should have a personal website. It's the cornerstone of a digital identity that makes you feel like an active online citizen rather than a passive consumer of goopy scroll.
