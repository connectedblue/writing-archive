Spent the last week or so trying to improve the experience for people who follow my blog via RSS, or visit it from the web.

I'm only going to publish a maximum of two main posts a day at set times. This means I can set up quite a bit of content in advance, so I give the RSS subscribers a teaser of what's coming soon in a small note at the bottom.
