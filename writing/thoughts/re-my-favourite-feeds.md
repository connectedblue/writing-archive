Kevin put out a [compilation of the best feeds](https://kevincox.ca/2024/02/29/favourite-feeds/) from his reader:

> I am an avid user of RSS feeds. Checking my list reveals that I am subscribed to 530 feeds! In the spirit of sharing I thought it would be interesting to share a snapshot of my current reading list. This may prove an interesting resource for someone looking to get started with feeds or just to grow their existing subscription list.
> 
> I’ve tried to focus on feeds that are generally interesting and have high value per-post. So these should get you some interesting content without exploding your reading queue. 

I'm also an avid reader of feeds. It's my primary source of information. I use a self hosted FreshRSS instance which has some nice management features when you have a lot of feeds.

I added Kevin's OPML link as a dynamic feed in a category called `Kevin`. That means I can browse his recommendations at leisure without impacting my main feed. I've already found a couple I want to follow permanently, so I just drag them into my blog category and that's done. When I've finished going through them, I can just delete the remainder.

I think it's a great way to share collections of stuff we like. Our readers already support OPML, so why not let them do the heavy lifting? It's much easier to produce and maintain than a blog roll or list of feed links.

It's been on my to-do list for my blog, so hopefully Kevin has inspired me to get this done soon. What I'm going to borrow from him is limiting the file to a number. I hadn't thought of that before, and while it will take some effort to curate, the resulting product will be much more useable for others.

After all, I'm pretty sure no-one wants the fire hose of 650+ feeds that I follow in my reader!
