Completed this on the day the book arrived. It's enormous and heavy and will probably take three years to read.

But I have a burning desire to get the whole lot inside my head, so it will be a project which I'll track in this blog. A companion to the companion.

The preface was as readable and precise as you would expect of any mathematical text. There was an account of how it came into being, and an overview of the various parts it is divided into.

I've got two bookmarks and may add more in the future. I think I will tackle the influences section first (Part VII) because I think it will set a motivating context for a number of articles in the technical sections. It's 14 articles in about 120 pages.

At the same time I'll read the introduction (Part I), and then into Part II on the origins of mathematics. I think that will lead on to Part VI which is a write up of the contributions of individual mathematicians in chronological order.

Hopefully that strategy will set me up for tackling the actual hard stuff in the middle.
