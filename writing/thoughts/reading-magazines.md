The more RSS feeds I follow, the more I have to think about arranging them in a taxonomy that makes sense for reading.

I have a number of sources that are multi author websites, but not covering news. These remind me of magazines. It didn't make sense to put them in the blog section, and they would just get lost in news. So I created a magazine category to put them in.

It's an eclectic mix of long form content, so I thought I'd share the latest articles here. The list changes every day, so feel free to bookmark this page and return if you wish.
