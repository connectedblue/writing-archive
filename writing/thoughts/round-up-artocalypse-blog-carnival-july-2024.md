July 2024 was the inaugural [Artocalypse Blog Carnival](https://the.artocalypse.org/upcoming-blog-carnivals/) and I had the pleasure of being the first host. The topic I chose was:

**My Digital Art Journey**

At the beginning of the month, I started by introducing the carnival and how to enter [in this blog post](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/artocalypse-blog-carnival-july-2024-my-digital-art-journey/).

There were six entries and you can read them all below. I've also included their RSS feed so you can continue to follow their future journey.

- [MY JOURNEY AND HOW I PRESENT MYSELF AND MY ART TO THE WORLD](https://aspenwrites.blogspot.com/2024/07/my-journey-and-how-i-present-myself-and.html) by Aspen ([rss](https://aspenwrites.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)).  
    Aspen has been writing their whole life, but expanded their art in other directions during covid. Poetry and art have now become intertwined which you can see through their website.  
      
    

- [My Digital Art Journey](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/my-digital-art-journey/) by Chris ([rss](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/feed)).  
    My entry, as a creative rather than an Artist. My art journey really began in 2020 while exploring projects to do with artists during lockdown.  
      
    

- [How the Internet Helped Me Be an Artist](https://iamkimberly.org/how-the-internet-helped-me-be-an-artist/) by Kimberly ([rss](https://iamkimberly.org/feed)).  
    Kimberly focuses on the scramble to grab a unique identifier on early internet services as also a foundation to solidifying your identity as an artist.  
      
    

- [The Start of my Digital Art Journey](https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/07/artocalypse-blog-carnival-july-2024-the-start-of-my-digital-art-journey/) by Sara ([rss](https://sarajaksa.eu/rss.xml)).  
    Sara very much embraces the social side of digital writing and started her journey commenting on Harry Potter books in an online forum. She had been writing before, but the act of sharing opened up a whole new world that eventually led to her own blog.  
      
    

- [art and the digital](https://dogboy.smol.pub/july2024artocalypse) by dogboy ([rss](https://dogboy.smol.pub/atom.xml))  
    Two major influences from digital are the communities that provide a receptive audience and the tools like the ipad. This leads to a process of editing - re-assembling and re-arranging blocks that already exist. But the main passion remains in the physical art that is close to home.  
      
    

- [Memory Bytes](https://heatherandbone.com/memory-bytes/) by Heather ([rss](https://heatherandbone.com/feed))  
    Starting out as an artist by designing a logo on powerpoint and experiencing the joy of seeing it printed on a tee shirt. Reminder that all journeys begin with a small step. Who knows that it will fuel a life long passion?  
    

That wraps up a super first carnival. Thank you so much to everyone who took part and told your story.
