I'm really curious . . .

Do people without a blog use RSS readers on a regular basis? I mean, of course, anyone can use RSS. But do they? Or is it just bloggers who are the avid users?

If you're reading this on RSS, and you don't have a blog, would you [contact me](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/contact-me/) and let me know?
