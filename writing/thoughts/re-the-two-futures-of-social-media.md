Scott contrasted [two views of an online future for social media](https://rscottjones.com/the-two-futures-of-social-media/) and concluded they are both here to stay:

> One model leverages the lottery ticket promise of virality to capture user-generated content to entertain the masses. It claims the zeitgeist of online culture, insomuch as one can exist in an algorithmically-personalized feed.
> 
> The other model requires personal sharing and discovery to build what resembles “local” communities, but ones connected by wifi instead of geography. It claims true friendships, insomuch as those can exist solely via posts and comments.

The nature of connection is also very different in mass versus individual media. A connection in mass media is really just two people who each have a connection to the mother ship and some communication is allowed to flow when she decides.

On the other hand, individual media enables one to one connection in numerous messy ways, as humans have done for millennia. I certainly do not feel alone on the IndieWeb.

Surprisingly often, I will stumble across a post in my RSS feed that links to a post I've written. I also get emails out of the blue from people who have read my blog.

I regularly send emails to bloggers I read. I love [writing reply posts](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/reply-posts/) that build on an ideas from others. I leave comments and fill out guestbooks.

It's not a dopamine fuelled journey. Having someone link to a post of mine, send an email, or any other individual connection is worth 10,000 mass media likes.

Our shared digital future looks bright.
