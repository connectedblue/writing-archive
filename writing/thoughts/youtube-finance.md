YouTube is a great source of high quality information to help you manage finances. You can find everything from investing strategies to detailed information on tax rules.

But, of course, you have to be careful selecting what to watch. There are many channels full of questionable, inaccurate or downright dangerous content.

The following channels are particularly good for specific parts of your investing journey .

- [Toby Newbatt](https://www.youtube.com/@TobyNewbatt) is a UK based investor who promotes long term, global index investing. His videos use market data to illustrate the upsides and downsides of various investing approaches.

- [Pete Matthews](https://www.youtube.com/@MeaningfulMoney) is a UK based financial planner who has an enormous compendium of videos on pretty much any topic you can think of. He is particularly good at explaining how the current tax rules work for different types of investment products.

- [Ben Felix](https://www.youtube.com/@BenFelixCSI) is a Canadian financial adviser who makes heavy use of academic literature to explain strategic approaches to investing

Here are the latest videos from these and other channels which I trust. The list changes every day, so feel free to bookmark this page and come back again . . .
