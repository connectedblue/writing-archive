Simon has put up a new [manifesto to normalise creativity](https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/lets-normalize-creativity).

> Everything we do as people is _creative_ - it’s the essence of life and consciousness. The thoughts you’re having right now about this idea - maybe you disagree and are formulating a rebuttal - are spontaneously arising in your mind and you’re using the ideas that fit together to create a belief that you can think and feel. That’s creative. That’s making something.

This is bang on. Artists do not have the monopoly on creativity, just as religious people don't on morals.

We call certain people "creatives". Or even worse, "content creators". Labels that reinforce a perception that creativity is for other people.

Perhaps there is a fear that creations have to be useful to others. But that's a very high bar to aim for. If you can create something for yourself, then you are creative.

There is perhaps a difference between making and creating. You might make the same lunch every day. A repeatable, necessary task that doesn't feel all that inspiring. But if, one day, you add a new topping, then you have crossed over from making to creating.

I'll be following Simon's posts closely in the coming weeks to see how this idea develops.
