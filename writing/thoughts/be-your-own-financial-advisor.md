If you want to become [financially independent](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/), you will need a solid corpus of advice to draw from when making decisions. Most people are familiar with how to earn and spend money, but fewer understand how to utilise money to build wealth.

It might be tempting to splash out on a professional to give yourself the maximum chance of success, but before doing so, consider how you acquire knowledge and skill in other parts of your life.

Whether it's coding, photography, sport, cooking, you probably spent most of the time researching on your own in various forms: looking at experts, experimenting with different techniques, practising often, talking with friends and so on. You may even sometimes have paid for professional instruction, but only after you acquiring sufficient background knowledge to know which areas needed improvement.

The only person who is really interested in your financial outcomes is your future self. So treat that person as your client. When you finally get to meet them, they will be super pleased you did so.

Financial advisors are skilled people, are (mostly) well regulated and are passionate about helping their clients. So what's not to love? Why not pick up the phone and get them working for you?

The primary reason is fees. Their advice is extremely expensive and significantly drains your future returns over the long term. Almost all base their annual fee on a percentage of your portfolio valuation.

Consider a 1% fee. Doesn't sound much does it? Well, an index fund invested under an ISA wrapper could expect to generate an average market return of 7-8%pa. So your fee is 12-14% of those annual returns.

Also, your fee applies to all future contributions. So every time you put new money in the market, the starting point is 99%, not 100%.

Financial advisors are not min wage workers. Their salary comes from a slice of your financial future.

Maybe you think that a financial advisor can beat the market to justify their fee? If so, don't forget to book [your morning wake up call](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/this-is-your-morning-wake-up-call/) (a service I genuinely offer for free).

There are [four factors to consider](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/) when building wealth, and investment return is the least important. Planning, forecasting and tax wrappers are much more important. As is your own temperament.

There is a huge amount of good quality guidance available to help you on your journey. If you don't know where to start, check out [these financial youtubers](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/youtube-finance/) who make a lot of effort to put together high quality information.

But the absolute best way is just to start. Once you have made a few investments, made some basic spreadsheets and read a few articles you will find yourself a lot more confident than when you started out.

At that point, you may even feel you need to engage the services of a financial advisor. But then, you'll be able to evaluate much better what they are saying because of your own background knowledge.

Either way, your financial outcomes will be greatly improved if you become your own financial advisor.
