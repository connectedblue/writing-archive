I've been asked recently for my thoughts about particular topics (usually [money related](/thoughts-on/money/)).

Rather than reply in messaging or email, it's usually more efficient for me to write a blog post instead. If that one person has a question about it, then usually someone else will.

So, if you follow my blog and want to hear my thoughts about something, please drop me an email on [chris@uncountable.uk](mailto:chris@uncountable.uk) and I'll do my best to compose the best post I can.

In general, I only write thoughts on things that I have experienced directly, and even then, will only write about my personal journey with that topic. I don't do research or think critically on this blog. Information is provided as-is.

So, if I don't have anything to write about your request, I'll let you know!
